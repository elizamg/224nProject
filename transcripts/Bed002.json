    "transcript": "OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless . And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . Yep . So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . No . No . Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . To try to read them while everyone else is . So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on . So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about stuff before everyone 's here . OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there . So this is transcript three six five one three six seven O . Three five one nine O three six four O two three O eight seven three nine eight seven five nine Uh , strike that . Eight seven nine five . nine O O six one zero zero one two two three five four five one O five two one Uh , five six four seven six seven eight O two one four O four six zero five five eight zero two eight . one six eight two eight two nine three . Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ? or ? Well , what we 're gonna we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio . So the Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s . Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight . Um , but uh , um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . Yep . Right . Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine , but we find that We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings . And so we don't wanna have to do aliases and we don't want people to be editing what they say . So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft . You know ? OK . So th Um . So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um . There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made . Anything else ? OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . It should be on already . Um . Either one of those . And uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent . Yeah . Right . And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over . And I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one . It 'll just be sitting here . Thank you ."
