    "transcript": "Nice . Right . Yeah , I 've have never handled them . Wow . Johno , where are you ? Should you go back to the first one ? Well Well , I mean , just to Yeah , um Well , \" the search for the middle layer \" . It 's basically uh talks about uh It just refers to the fact that uh one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were , you know , because Can you maximize the window ? Can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn't doesn't appear ? OK , fine . Alright . Yeah . No . We have a separate feature . Like you could have a p You Like you could have a post office with uh you know , nice murals or something . Architecturally appealing from the outside . Yeah , we meant , uh , touristic reasons . Yeah . Yep . Well usually , I mean , you know , N If you have N features , then it 's two to the N or exponential in N . Yeah , they 'd all be like pointing to the one node . Want to do Vista , right ? Because if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry . Yeah , that one needs a lot of Not at all . That 's that that needs a lot of work . But uh that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter , so we decided that for the purposes of this it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs . OK , so Yeah , so note the four nodes down there , the sort of , the things that are not directly extracted . Actually , the five things . The \" closed \" is also not directly extracted I guess , from the uh Hmm . Actually , no , wait . It is . OK , \" closed \" sort of is . Right , so f Right , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things . Yeah . And the mode , you know , depends on all those things only . Yeah . So we haven't uh , managed Like we don't have nodes for \" discourse \" and \" parse \" , although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net . But uh The idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse , because we 'd never do inference on it anyway , so . whether they discuss the admission fees . So we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like \" Can I get to this place ? \" \" What is the admission fee ? \" . So that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to Enter the place rather than uh to Tango or Vista , so . That was like our example . Um . Yeah , I m I mean Yeah . Right . So let 's see . The variables . Disc - \" admission fee \" is a binary thing , \" time of day \" is like morning , afternoon , night . Is that the deal ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , I guess . So Right , so it 's not really all of context . Similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed . and Yeah . Unknown , right ? Which is th Which one ? Yeah , it does . Everything is probablistic , and There 's always Yeah . Um , right . So then landmark is Oh , sorry . \" Verb used \" is like , right now we only have three values , but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs . Rather , let me rephrase that . It it can take values in the set of all verbs , that they could possibly use . Um \" nice walls \" is binary , \" closed \" is binary \" final destination \" , again Yeah , all those are binary I guess . And \" mode \" is one of three things . Yeah , anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node . Which things ? Oh . \" Nice walls \" is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge . Yeah , a Oh yeah . Sorry . It is binary . That 's true . Yeah . OK , I see your point . Yeah , similarly \" closed \" , I guess . Well , we To do that we would add another uh value for that . And that would require s updating the probability distribution for \" mode \" as well . Because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account . Yeah . Right . Other syntactic information you mean ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , right . Yeah , correct . We can do a little demo . I mean We can do a demo in the sense that we can um , just ob observe the fact that this will , in fact do inference . So we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes . Just se set a few of them . You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time . Just like uh , maybe the fact that they use a certain verb Actually forget the verb . just uh I don't know , say they discussed the admission fee and uh the place has nice walls and it 's night . Yeah , no wait . That that doesn't uh it 's not really consistent . They don't discuss the admission fee . Make that false . And it 's night . That didn't work . OK . Yes . \" Go \" and , right , \" query \" . So that is the probability that they 're Entering , Vista - ing or Tango - ing . And uh Yeah . It loves the Tango . Well , that 's obviously just to do with our probabilities . Like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , right . We were like \" hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , fifty per \" Like , you know . So obviously that 's gonna happen . Yeah . It 's So we have to like fit the probabilities . Yeah . Um . Well , yeah , I guess . Not that much though . Only a little early . OK . Um . Yeah , well That 's that 's an interesting point . Whether you 're It 's whether It 's not I think it 's more like \" Are you are tourist ? are you in Ham - like Heidelberg for a \" That 's a different thing . What if the context , which is not set , but still they say things like , \" I want to go uh , see the uh the the castle and uh , et cetera . \" Yeah . Business on the other hand is , uh , definitely what you 're doing . Yeah . And that 'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you kinda thing . Yeah , I think this context node is a bit of a I don't know , like in d Uh Do we wanna have Like it 's If the context were to set one way or another , that like strongly uh um , says something about whether whether or not they 're tourists . So what 's interesting is when it 's not when it 's set to \" unknown \" . Right now we haven't observed it , so I guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities . But yes , you can set it to un \" unknown \" . Well no , because we Th - the way we set the probabilities might not have Yeah , it 's it 's an it 's an issue , right ? Like Yeah , it is . So the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then \" unknown \" as an actual value . What 's common is you just like don't observe the variable , right , and then just marginalizes But uh We didn't do this because we felt that there 'd I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually But uh I don't know y what the right thing is to do for that . I 'm not I don't know if I totally am happy with the way it is . Another node on what ? Good point . So basically it 's addressing a variable that 's \" enterable or not \" . So like an \" enterable , question mark \" . What ? Um . Not when we were doing this , but I guess at some point we did . So you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered ? Yeah . Hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . What would it , uh , connect to ? Like , what would , uh , it affect ? What I was thinking was if you had a like Yeah . OK . Right . Yeah , I don't know if JavaBayes is nice about that . It might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable , you just like it just overwrites everything . But you can check . OK . It 's true . Well that 's fine , but we have to see the function now . Has it become all point fives or not ? No . This is fine , this business . Yep . What would be nice if it is if it just like kept the old function for either value but . Nope . Didn't do it . That 's kind of annoying . Hmm . Ha - So have you used JavaBayes a lot ? OK . It might be worth uh asking around . Like , we looked at sort of uh a page that had like a bunch of OK . Yeah , S I guess he 'd be the person . Yeah . Cuz Yeah . I mean in a way this is a lot of good features in Java it 's cra has a GUI and it 's uh I guess those are the main two things . It does learning , it has What ? OK . Oh right . Maybe you 're right . OK . Right . But uh it 's free . But uh , yeah . Maybe another thing that uh But I mean its interface is not the greatest . So . Yeah . There is actually a text file that you can edit . But it 's You don't have to do that . Is it XML ? Oh , I see . No this doesn't use it . I didn't think it did . You can look at the text file . But do you have it here ? Well , maybe you don't . Oh yes , of course . Like , there 's the Nope . Just s l start up a new DOS . Or Yeah , right . Yep . It 'll ask you what you what it wants what you want to open it with and see what BAT , I guess . That 's Oh ! Anyway , there it is . Uh , Yeah . Yeah . That 's how actual probability tables are specified . As , like , lists of numbers . So theoretically you could edit that . But they 're not very friendly . So you 'd have to like figure out Like you have to go and Yeah . Well I Yeah . I think so . it 's not Yeah we can maybe write an interface th for uh entering probability distributions easily , something like like a little script . That might be worth it . The other thing is it is in Java so . Yeah . Uh , yeah . we do I I saw directory called \" source \" , or Yeah . Go up one ? Yeah . I don't know if it actually manipulate the source , though . That might be a bit complicated . I think it might it might be simpler to just have a script that , you know It 's , like , friendly , it allows you enter things well . Mm - hmm . He 's Like this guy has ? The JavaBayes guy ? So but , e he doesn't use it . So in what sense has he updated it ? Oh . I see . OK . That would be awesome . OK . Um . The additional thing is I guess learning the probabilities , also . E That 's maybe , I don't know If Does That 's Yeah . Very future . Ha . Sure . Yeah . Sure . Yep . Yeah . So essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little Bayes - nets of their own . Yeah . That 's true . Yeah . Or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . Like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . So it 's like There are Those are the two options . Either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . Really . Yeah . Yeah . What ? Why ? Really ? @ @ Yeah . And there 's much more of them . Yeah , they 're Yeah , it 's way better Yeah . I 've done that kind of thing . I I want to see what it does with uh \" landmark - iness \" . That 's So . Yeah . OK . For which ? Just observable nodes , evidence nodes ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , this is totally like The probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc . We need to look at all of them . I mean but , they 're even like I mean like , close to the end we were like , uh , you know we were like uh really ad - hoc . Right ? Cuz if it 's like , uh If it 's four things coming in , right ? And , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that . So you 're thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible things numbers to enter , right ? So . Yeah , the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect . Yeah . Yeah , another thing to do , um , is also to , um I guess to ask around people about other Bayes - net packages . Is Srini gonna be at the meeting tomorrow , do you know ? Wait Day after tomorrow . Yeah . Maybe we can ask him about it . No . But he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking , I forget who . Uh . Oh . But . OK . But once you start sart start SmartKom you can be on You don't have to be on a network anymore . Is that the deal ? Ah , interesting . So who would be the subject of this trial run ? Who Will there be a Is one Is you one of you gonna be the subject ? Like are you Well I just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . Yeah . I mean that 's what we wanna check , right ? Isn't that what it is ? I guess that would be reasonable . Sort of having an actively antagonistic , uh OK . Yep . So what 's \" Economics , the fallacy \" ? Oh , really ? OK ."
