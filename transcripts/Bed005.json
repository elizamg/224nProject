    "transcript": "OK . Ami , do yours then we 'll open it and I think it 'll be enough . OK . So , we all switched on ? Alright . Anyway . So , uh , before we get started with the , uh , technical part , I just want to review what I think is happening with the our data collection . So Uh , probably after today , that shouldn't come up in this meeting . Th - this this is s should be im it isn't There 's another thing going on of gathering data , and that 's pretty much independent of this . But , uh , I just want to make sure we 're all together on this . What we think is gonna happen is that , uh , in parallel starting about now we 're gonna get Fey to , where you 're working with me and Robert , draft a note that we 're gonna send out to various CogSci c and other classes saying , \" here 's an opportunity to be a subject . Contact Fey . \" And then there 'll be a certain number of um , hours during the week which she will be available and we 'll bring in people . Uh , roughly how many , Robert ? We d Do we know ? OK . So , we 're looking for a total of fifty people , not necessarily by any means all students but we 'll s we 'll start with with that . In parallel with that , we 're gonna need to actually do the script . And , so , I guess there 's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon Uh , with uh , Jane , and maybe Liz and whoever , on actually getting the script worked out . But what I 'd like to do , if it 's O K , is to s to , as I say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week . The week after that 's Spring Break , and maybe we 'll look for them some subjects next door or i Oh , OK , then we won't do it . OK . So that 's easy . Um . So , is Is that make sense to everybody ? That 's a good idea . Oh , yeah . The high school 's a great idea . And why don't you also copy Jane on it ? Uh , th I think they 're necessary . This The permission form . Uh , there has to be one , and I think we 're just gonna use it as it is , and Um Well , yeah . There 's one tricky part about , um , they have the right um I The last paragraph \" if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . \" OK ? Now that , we had to be included for this other one which might have , uh , meetings , you know , about something . In this case , it doesn't really make sense . Um , so what I 'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying \" I don't want to see the final transcript \" . And if they don't If they say \" no , I 'm not willing to sign that \" , then we 'll show them the final transcript . But , um . That , uh yeah , so we might actually , um S i Jane may say that , \" you know , you can't do this \" , uh , \" on the same form , we need a separate form . \" But anyway . I 'd I 'd I 'd like to , e e um , add an a little thi eh a thing for them to initial , saying \" nah , do I don't want to see the final transcript . \" But other than that , that 's one 's been approved , this really is the same project , uh , rec you know . And so forth . So I think we just go with it . Yep . Which is not a lot . But OK . Right . Yeah , we can show us , right ? Yep . So , you can sho You you Are are you gonna show us the little templates ? Well , that sounds No i Well Actually , it 's a little tricky , in that there 's some allowable German orders which aren't allowable English orders and so forth . And it is order - based . So it it Isn't it ? Oh . So it it doe I it These u these optional elements , it 's it 's actually a set , not a sequence ? Oh ! Really a se Oh , wow . Do I ? Right . Yeah . OK . Capitalized as well Y i p Oh . So so , the point is , if it says \" this \" and \" see \" , it also will work in \" see \" and \" this \" ? In the other order ? with those two key words ? \" This is the one I want to see \" or whatever . OK , so it is set - based . Alright . OK . No , no . Fine . Yeah , yeah , yeah , flexible it is . Alright . Yep . So - That 'd be great . It would be a good exercise to just see whether one can get that to run . Hmm ? Oh , yeah . y Yeah . They also seem to affect state , cause some of them there were other actions uh , that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere , like the n s \" Discourse Status Confirm \" . OK . So that 's going to be a call on the discourse and confirm that it 's I think that 's right . I think it 's actually That looks like it 's state modification . Yeah . Oh , so it always just Is it So it Well , go back , then , cuz it may be that all those th things , while they look like function calls , are just a way of adding exactly that to the XML . Uh - huh ! I 'm not I 'm not sure . e I 'm not sure e that Right . Right . Right . Yep . Right . Absolutely . Good point . It 's it 's the It 's under what sub - type you 're doing it . Yeah . Yeah , each is S so that 's funny . You bury the s the state in the function Alright . Uh @ @ Yeah . \" I want two seats here . \" No , right , the Discourse Maintainer , yeah . I see . And it and it runs around looking for Discourse Status tags , and doing whatever it does with them . And other people ignore those tags . Alright . So , yeah . I definitely think it 's It 's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there . Uh Disc - Yeah , a kid understanding what 's going on . Then the next thing we talked about is actually , um , figuring out how to add our own tags , and stuff like that . Yep . S So these are these are your friends back at EML . So this is not a complicated negotiation . There 's there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ? Great . So this is just trying to It 's a design thing , not a political thing . Once we 've eh We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done . Good . Mm - hmm . So , well , let Now , this is important . Let , uh I want a a Again , outside of m almost managerial point , um You 're in the midst of this , so you know better . But it seems to me it 's probably a good idea to li uh minimize the number of uh , change requests we make of them . So it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together . OK ? And think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes . Oh . Does this does this make sense to you guys ? It I mean you 're you 're doing the the interaction but it seemed to me that what we ought to do is come up with a uh , something where you , um And I I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it . Probably Johno . OK . Uh , take what they have , send it to everybody saying \" this is what they have , this is what we think we should add \" , OK ? and then have a d a an iteration within our group saying \" Hmm , well \" OK ? And get our best idea of what we should add . And then go back to them . Is i or , I don't know does this make sense to you ? Or Mm - hmm . Right . Right . That 's right . So . So , Yeah . The problem isn't the short ra range optimization . It 's the sort of o one or two year kind of thing . OK . What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ? How how would we try to characterize those and what do we want to request now that 's leave enough space to do all that stuff ? Right . And that re that requires some thought . And so that sounds like a great thing to do as the priority item um , as soon as we can do it . So y so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um , this , and the uh , description Well b Yeah . So , the the uh Not everyone uh , reads German , so if you 'd um tu uh , tur change the description to , uh , English and , um , Then then , yeah . Then , with some sug s suggestions about where where do we go from here ? Uh , this and this , of course , was just the action end . Uh , at some point we 're going to have to worry about the language end . But for the moment just uh , t for this class of of things , we might want to try to encompass . And Oh , yeah , yeah yeah yeah . This is this is everything that that , um , you know , um we might want to do in the next couple years . We don't I mean , that 's an issue . We don't know what , entirely . Right . No . I think I think the i the idea is that Oh . It 's beyond Source - Path - Goal , but I think we don't need to get beyond it @ @ tourists in Heidelberg . It seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in Heidelberg . OK ? But you know , i depending on what people are interested in , one could have , uh , tours , one could have um , explanations of why something is is , you know , why why was this done , or I mean , no there 's no end to the complexity you can build into the uh , what a tourist in Heidelberg might ask . So , at least unless somebody else wants t to suggest otherwise I think the general domain we don't have t to uh , broaden . That is , tourists in Heidelberg . And if there 's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way , then , sure . W we 'll we 'll look at that , but uh I 'd be s I I 'd be surprised at if there 's any important issue that that And , um I mean if if you want to uh , push us into reference problems , that would be great . OK , so this is his specialty is reference , and you know , what what are these things referring to ? Not only anaphora , but , uh , more generally the , uh this whole issue of , uh , referring expressions , and , what is it that they 're actually dealing with in the world ? And , again , this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed because there is an ontology , and the database , and stuff . So it isn't like , um , you know , the Evening Star or stuff like that . I i it All the entities do have concrete reference . Although th the To get at them from a language may not be trivial . There aren't really deep mysteries about um , what w what things the system knows about . All those things . Yeah . You have proper names , and descriptions . And a l and a lot and and anaphora , and pronouns , and all those things . He knows . Yeah . Or , you know , the church across from City Hall , or Yeah , that would be fine . Yeah . Or you can say \" how \" you know , \" how do I get back ? \" OK . And , again , it 's just a question of which of these things , uh , people want to dive into . What , uh , I think I 'm gonna try to do , and I guess , pwww ! let 's say that by the end of spring break , I 'll try to come up with some general story about , um , construction grammar , and what constructions we 'd use and how all this might fit together . There 's this whole framework problem that I 'm feeling really uncomfortable about . And I haven't had a chance to think about it seriously . But I I want to I want to do that early , rather than late . And you and I will probably have to talk about this some . Hmm . Oh , yeah ? Well , I mean yeah , I d Yeah . You will . Oh , yeah . I mean , uh , we could take all the standard metaphor examples and make question versions of them . OK . Yeah , or , you know . \" Wh - why is he why is he pushing for promotion ? \" or , \" who 's pushing proof \" er , just pick pick any of them and just do the eh So I don't I don't think , uh , it 's at all difficult Uh , to convert them to question forms that really exist and people say all the time , um And sort of we don't know how to handle them , too . Right ? I mean , it 's I d It We don't know how to handle the declarative forms , @ @ really , and , then , the interrogative forms , ah - oh . Uh . Yeah . Nancy , it looked like you were s Right . Yes . Right . No , I think that 's one of things that 's interesting , is is in this sort of over - arching story we we worked it out for th as you say , this the storytelling scenario . And I think it 's really worth thinking through what it looks like . What is the simspec mean , et cetera . Well , I don't know . I mean , maybe maybe that 's what we 'll do is is s u e We can do anything we want with it . I mean , once we have fulfilled these requirements , OK , and the one for next uh , summer is just half done and then the other half is this , um , \" generation thing \" which we think isn't much different . So once that 's done , then all the rest of it is , uh , sort of , you know , what we want to do for the research . And we can w we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all . Th - there 's no reason why we 're c we 're constrained to do that . If we can use all the , uh , execution engines , then we can , you know , really try things that would be too too much pain to do ourselves . But there 's no obligation on any of this . So , if we want to turn it into u understan standing stories about Heidelberg , we can do that . I mean , that would just be a t a um Yeah . You might , yeah . Right . Anyway . S Who 's going ? Ah ! OK . So eh Yeah . So , what happened is , there 's this , eh , uh Robert was describing the There 's two packages there 's a , uh , quote parser , there 's a particular piece of this big system , which , in German , uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces XML structures . And one of our jobs was to make the English equivalent of that . That , these guys did in a in a day . The other thing is , at the other end , roughly at the same level , there 's something that takes , uh , X M L structures , produces an output XML structure which is instructions for the generator . OK ? And then there 's a language generator , and then after that a s a synthesizer that goes from an XML structure to , uh , language generation , to actual specifications for a synthesizer . Eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece that we have to convert to English . Is that OK . And that But as I say , this is all along was viewed as a kind of a m a minor thing , necessary , but but not OK ? And much more interesting is the fact that , as part of doing this , we we are , you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other things . Not precisely what we want , and that 's that 's wh where it it gets difficult . And I I don't pretend to understand yet what I think we really ought to do . OK . Good ! OK . Good . And what 's the other one ? so that just we know what the d agenda is ? Oh , yeah . I 've got a couple new Wu papers as well . Uh , so I I 've been in contact with Wu , so , probably let 's put that off till I I till I understand better , uh , what he 's doing . It 's just a little embarrassing cause all this was in his thesis and I was on his thesis committee , and , so , I r really knew this at one time . But , I I It 's not only uh Is Part of what I haven't figured out yet is is how all this goes together . So I 'll dig up some more stuff from Dekai . And so why don't we just do the , uh Yeah . You could squealing sound ? It 's probably just as easy . I That 's why they invented \" pocket T 's \" . Wri - write it out for for So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ? Good . Well . OK , so th so the important point is W not what the G function is . The important point is that Um There is a a a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT . Th - c the full conditional probability table with some function . OK ? Which y w you choose appropriately for each case . So , depending on what your situation is , there are different functions which are most appropriate . And So I gave eh Bhaskara a copy of this , eh sort of \" ninety - two \" paper . D and you got one , Robert . I don't know who else has seen it . It 's short . It 's short . So , I u w Um , yo uh you Have you read it yet ? OK , so you should take a look . Nancy , I 'm sure you read it at some point in life . OK . And so , you other guys can decide how interested Anyway . So the paper isn't th isn't real hard . And Uh One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is , \" How much of this does JavaBayes support ? \" Right . Right . So the little handout that The little thing that I sent I sent a message saying , uh , here is a way to take One thing you could do , which is kind of s in a way , stupid , is take this deterministic function , and use it to build the CPT . So , if Ba - JavaBayes won't do it for you , that you can convert all that into what the CPT would be . Um and , what I sent out about a week ago , was an idea of how to do that , for , um , evidence combination . So one of one function that you could use as your \" G function \" is an e e Evidence - Combining . So you just take the uh , if each of th if each of the ones has its own little table like that , then you could take the , uh , strength of each of those , times its little table , and you 'd add up the total evidence for \" V \" , \" E \" , and \" A \" . Yep . Right . I i i No , no But I 'm saying is There There is a w I mean , if y if if you decide what 's what is appropriate , is probablistic evidence combination , you can write a function that does it . It 's a pui it 's actually one of the examples he 's got in there . But , anyway , s skipping skipping the question of exactly which functions now is it clear that you might like to be able to shortcut the whole conditional probability table . Right . That 's one of the problems , is , W Is is , Where would th Where would it all come from ? Yeah , so there 's there 's two separate things , Robert . The f the the the Bayes - nets in general are quite good at saying , \" if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that . \" OK ? Th - that 's what they 're real good at . So , if you don't have any information about the discourse , you just use your priors of of whatever eh the discourse uh , eh , basically whatever w it 's Probabilistically , whatever it would be . And it 's it 's sort of not a great estimate , but it 's the best one you have , and , so forth . So that , they 're good at . But the other problem is , how do you fill in all these numbers ? And I think that 's the one he was getting at . Well , pretty quickly . I mean Eh well to some No , no . So , \" Noisy - OR \" is a funny way of referring to this , because the Noisy - OR is only one instance . That one actually isn't a Noisy - OR . So we 'll have to think of of a way t t Yeah , whatever . Yeah . So Eh Um Yeah , it it Tha - that 's true . It is a is also more neural - net - like , although Uh , it isn't necessarily sum uh , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that . I mean i You could have , uh , like the Noisy - OR function , really is one that 's essentially says , uh , take the max . Same . Uh But anyway . So And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people get around the uh There are a couple other ones . There are ways of breaking this up into s to to subnets and stuff like that . But , um The I think we definitely I think it 's a great idea tha to to pursue that . Right . Oh . Yeah . No . So , i is Well , let me say something , guys , cuz there 's not There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now . Which is The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology is just what you want for this . So that Uh , if you know about it let 's say , a particular town hall that , it 's one that is a monument , then , that would be stored there . If you don't , you look up the hierarchy , Eh so , you you you may or So , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode . Let 's OK , so we have the EVA vector for for various kinds of landmarks . If you know it for a specific landmark you put it there . If you don't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one . Absolutely . Uh , or , link to or but but in any case i View it logically as being in the ontology . It 's part of what you know about a an object , is its EVA vector . And , if yo As I say , if you know about a specific object , you put it there . This is part of what Dekai was doing . So , when we get to Wu , The - e We 'll see w what he says about that . And , then if you If it isn't there , it 's higher , and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's it 's a building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior . If you don't know anything else about a building , uh , you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level , which might be equal , or whatever it is . So , that 's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology . And it seems to me the obvious thing to do , unless we find a reason to do something different . Does this make sense to you ? Bhask - ? Indeed . So , that 's another thing we 're gonna need to do , is is , to , either We 're gonna need some way to either get a p tag in the ontology , or add fields , or some way to associate Or , w It may be that all we can do is , um , some of our own hash tables that it Th - the th you know , there 's always a way to do that . It 's a just a question of i th Yeah . e Right . And , so , i uh Right . Yeah . Well , they they they How ar What are they gonna do with instances ? I mean , you y OK . But what i What is SmartKom gonna do about that ? Cuz , they have instances all the time . But Uh uh SmartKom 's gonna need an ontology . I understand , but is anybody doing anything about it ? OK . It 's a political problem . We won't worry about it . Yeah . Anyway . So we may have to This is with the whole thing , we may have to build another data stru Conceptually , we know what should be done . When we see what people have done , it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a a separate thing that that just pools i i Like , i i it it may be , that , the the instance w That we have to build our own instance , uh , things , that , with their types , and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type . So we build a little data structure And so what we would do in that case , is , in our instance gadget have our E V As . And if we d there isn't one we 'd get the type and then have the E V As for the type . So we 'd have our own little , uh , EVA tree . And then , for other , uh , vectors that we need . So , we 'd have our own little things so that whenever we needed one , we 'd just use the ontology to get the type , and then would hash or whatever we do to say , \" ah ! If it 's that type of thing , and we want its EVA vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . \" So , I I think we can handle that . And then But , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in Java Bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is , uh is the bigger deal . I think that 's where we have to get technically clever . Well , I me ye eh , yeah , the Yeah , I mean , it 's , uh , e e e e e cute . I mean , you 've been around enough to I mean Just ? I mean , there 's this huge package which which may or may not be consistent and you know . But , yeah , we could look at it . Yeah . It 's b It It 's an inter sort of a kind of a it The thing is , it 's kind of an interpreter and i i it expects its data structures to be in a given form , and if you say , \" hey , we 're gonna make a different kind of data structure to stick in there \" It may or may not . I don't know . That 's the question is \" to what extent does it allow us to put in these G functions ? \" And I don't know . Yeah , that 's fine if it 's if it comes only at the end . But suppose you want it embedded ? Oh , that Yeah , that 's a truly horrible way to do d it . One would hope Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , you bet . But , at that point you may say , \" hey , Java Bayes isn't the only package in town . Let 's see if there 's another package that 's , eh , more civilized about this . \" Now , Srini is worth talking to on this , cuz he said that he actually did hack some combining functions into JavaBayes. But he doesn't remember at least when I talked to him , he didn't remember whether it was an e an easy thing , a natural thing , or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work . Uh . But he did do it . Well , I say that 's one way to do it , is is to just convert it int into a into a C P T that you zip It 's blown up , and is a it 's , uh it 's huge , but it doesn't require any data fitting or complication . I I understand . I 'm just saying tha that w That was wi that was my note . The little note I sent said that . It said , \" Here 's the way you 'd take the logical f G function and turn it into a CPT . \" I mean that the Max - the Evidence - Combining function . So we could do that . And maybe that 's what we 'll do . But , um don't know . So , I will , e e before next week , uh , @ @ p push push some more on on this stuff that Dekai Wu did , and try to understand it . Uh , you 'll make a couple of more copies of the Heckerman paper to give to people ? OK . And , um I think Well , you and I should talk about it . Alright , great ! And , Robert , thank you for coming in under He he 's been sick , Robert ."
