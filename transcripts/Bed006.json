    "transcript": "Hi . Oh wow . Not yet . Yeah right . I 've got the headset on after all . yes . I know Nancy . Man ! Wizard . The list of majors in the department ? So you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ? I 'm not sure I totally understand this but I 'm not sure I totally understand everything that 's being talked about but I I imagine I 'll c just catch on . Uh , this is where they 're supposed to Yeah . Yeah . OK . OK . OK . OK . OK . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Hmm . You will be here . They 're very dependent We 're done . Toll . So it 's not done basically . Right . Perhaps if the answers have something to do with the questions for example . I want to see \" Die Dukes Von Hazard \" @ @ Mm - hmm . OK . \" Chicken Run \" . OK . What 's the next thing ? OK . Mm - hmm . OK . Spit right here . A laser pointer would be most appropriate here I think . Mm - hmm . Rad ! Mm - hmm . Hmm . So very specific role names are \" viewed thing \" , \" entered thing \" Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . Snack action . See . I 'm sure there 's a commercial event schema in there somewhere . Yeah I mean I I still am not entirely sure that I really fully grasp the syntax of this . You know , like what Right . Or the intended interpretation of this . Yeah . Yeah . OK . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yep . Every SPG every SPG action either is an Enter or a View or an Approach , right ? OK . This is a cate this a category structure here , right ? Action schema . What are some types of action schemas ? Well one of the types of action schemas is Source - Path - Goal action . And what are some types of that ? And an Enter , a View , an Approach . Those are all Source - Path - Goal actions . Mm - hmm . There could be a communication event action or something like that and you could write it . Ri - You 'd like so you 're saying you could practically turn this structure inside out ? or something , or ? List all the parent categories . Yeah . Yeah . This sounds like a paper I 've read around here recently in terms of Yeah . Yeah I mean but there 's a good question here . Like , I mean uh do you When do you need Hhh . Damn this headset ! When you this uh , eh Yeah . That 's all recorded . Um . Why do you Hhh . I don't know . Like How do I how do I come at this question ? Um . I just don't see why you would I mean does th Who uses this uh this data structure ? You know ? Like , do you say \" alright I 'm going to uh do an SPG action \" . And then you know somebody ne either the computer or the user says \" alright , well , I know I want to do a Source - Path - Goal action so what are my choices among that ? \" And \" oh , OK , so I can do an Enter - View - Approach \" . It 's not like that , right ? It 's more like you say \" I want to , uh I want to do an Enter . \" And then you 're more interested in knowing what the parent categories are of that . Right ? So that the um the uh sort of representation that you were just talking about seems more relevant to the kinds of things you would have to do ? OK . OK . OK . Mayb - Well maybe I 'm not understanding where this comes from and where this goes to . What are we doing with this ? In principle . Sigh . Right . Yeah . Yeah . In my view . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Again Well I I would just like to ask um like , if it could happen for next time , I mean , just beca cuz I 'm new and I don't really just I just don't know what to make of this and what this is for , and stuff like that , you know , so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it , like first of all what modules are talking to each other using this , right ? And OK . Right . Nope . Alright . OK . Sure . Sure . Oh you meant pastries , then ? This is the bakery example . Got it . Alright . Help ! Mm - hmm . Uh Yeah . I could do that . Yeah I mean earlier on Friday is better but three you know I mean if it were a three or a three thirty time then I would take the three or whatever , but yeah sure three is fine . I mean . Yeah . Yeah . So already again this week , huh ? Yeah . Between now and then . Promise ? Yeah . I think you 've got one on hand , huh ? It 's rad , even ! It happened to c be what it stands for . Oh \" rich de \" Everybody likes action . Plus it 's hip . The kids 'll like it . OK ."
