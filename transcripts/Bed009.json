OK , uh What 's Uh , my transcript number is , um , L n ninety - one one four one six , two , eight six one three w one five seven , O three nine five , eight , w uh , O , six six two two , four two , O three , one six , one four three four one , six one seven , one three four O six five two , one O five , nine eight two one four O , u eight four , nine two , u one two , s six five eight six , six six , one three , one one , one O two O , six six , six five , four one , five nine . Hi . Mmm . Mmm . Mmm , yep . Yeah , very much Yeah Hmm . Oh Hmm . Mmm . Hmm . Hmm . Hmm . Hmm , ah . Mmm . Huh . Mmm . Mmm . Mmm . Hmm . Hmm . Mmm . Yep . Hmm . Mmm . uh , No , it 's it 's also a quantrant uh uh I think . Hmm . Mm - hmm . Mmm . Yeah , it 's it 's not defined yet . Um Yeah . Mmm . Yeah , there 's a meeting next next week I think Mmm . Mmm . Mmm . Mmm . Yeah . Mmm . Mmm . Hmm . Yeah , are there currently is uh no syntactic analysis but in the next release there will be some . unless and it 's um uh you can access this Hmm . um it 's to to integrate and syntactic analysis . and um add some more features like segmentation . So then an utter more than one utterance is There um there 's often uh pause between it and a segmentation occurs . um yeah No no it 's uh I think it 's it 's totally complicated for it 's just one one person and so I have to keep the Yeah , ah and so things must be simpler but uh , Miel syntactic analysis with um finite state transducers . Yeah , uh the problem is th that it has to be very fast because um if you want to for more than one path anywhere what 's in the latches from the speech recognizer so it 's speed is crucial . uh And they are not fast enough . And they also have to be very robust . cuz of um speech recognition errors and @ @ I think it 's that might , at Tuebingen I thought . was Do you know something about that ? In Tub - at oh Oh from from Stuttgart , yeah , also Mm - hmm . yeah . yeah that 's In this direction , yes Yeah , it 's in in this direction . Mm - hmm , yeah , it would be very interesting , Mm - hmm . Mmm , yeah . Hmm . Mm - hmm . um yeah , I 've I 've looked at it but but it 's no not much uh information available . I found , but it 's also finite - state transducers , I thought . and Yeah , and and Purely finite - state transducers are not so good for German since there 's um The word order is is uh not fixed Yeah . Mm - hmm . Also it 's uh it 's um Yes , uh the um choice between uh this processing and that processing and my template matcher . @ @ Um , yeah but it 's all in the in the lexicon . So it 's Yeah th the information is available . So Yeah Yeah , we can , oh yeah . We have knowledge bases from from Verbmobil system we can use and so . It um Yeah , but but it 's used for for stem forms . @ @ Oh , OK . What ? Hmm . Yeah Mm - hmm . um Not yet but it 's planned to do that . Yeah Oh yes . um Yeah , it 's um I think it 's um yes , it 's it 's um possible to to do list processing . and Maybe this is um more adequate for English and in German um set processing is used . Maybe yeah . Some extensions uh have to be made . For for a English version Mm - hmm , yeah . Ah mmm . No . Oder there was an talk ? uh Mmm , yeah . Ah . Mmm , ah . Mmm . Mmm . Mmm . Mmm . Hmm . Ah , OK ."
