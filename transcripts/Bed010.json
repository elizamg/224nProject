    "transcript": "@ @ Thank you . OK . OK . OK . Oh , \" Am Spartacus . \" Verstehe . OK . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . Mm - hmm . OK . N , V yeah , OK . Alright . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So . Like . Yeah . I I still don't I still don't really understand e like I mean we sort of say , um You know , I I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ? R uh Sure . Yeah , soon . OK . That 's fine . OK . And I remember one thing that that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , I I think he talked about the idea of like , um He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of for each word you , um For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's that 's HPSG or whatever . You know ? Yeah . Mm - hmm . Right . Make our stuff fit to that . Uh - huh . Mm - hmm . OK . Right . OK . OK . Oh OK . Right . Right , yeah . Hmm . Oh OK . Mm - hmm . Yeah . OK . Got it . Yeah . Right , OK . OK . OK . So I mean , the the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been sort of been geared towards this demo , and then that 's going to go away pretty soon . OK . And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially , huh ? Mm - hmm . OK . OK . Right . OK . Yeah . Uh - huh . Yeah . OK . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . OK , right . Yeah . It 's alright . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of OK . Right . OK . Yeah . Alright . OK . Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there I could swore uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the with the system ? Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to to look at what look at the stuff , and see what people are saying . Yeah , u OK . Yeah , I mean I I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know . It was just Strange , but . Oh yeah , OK . OK , yeah , I mean . Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff , and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know , \" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , \" or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So , um , now that was the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction he 'd what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , \" your bike is parked across the street \" and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , \" well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike \" , but um in in Japanese the the more conventionalized tendency is to use a sort of a description of \" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree \" . Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , \" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river \" , or something like that . So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like \" right where you start to go up the hill \" , or \" just when you get off the train \" , or something like that to uh , to indicate where something is . So we 'll have to think about OK . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . Yeah . OK . Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is . OK . Right . I think Mm - hmm . Hmm . I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in in English depending o You know , like , \" in front of the car \" could you know Like , here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . I could see that , but But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was this was a a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh . Alright ! Cool ! Hmm . Hmm . The origin . Yeah . Oh , OK . I never heard it . OK . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . You you can actually say things like , um , \" it 's behind the tree from me \" or something like that , I think , in in in certain circumstances in English , right ? As sort of \" from where I 'm standing it would appear that \" Yeah . Oh , OK . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Me too . Huh . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah , yeah . Circuits . That 's cool . Yeah yeah . Yeah . What 's going on at the end of the tool , yeah . What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever . Yeah . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . Yeah . That 's cool . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Alright . I OK . Mm - hmm . Right . OK . Yeah . Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ? OK . Yeah . I see . Right . OK . Good to know . Oh , OK . Alright . Cuz I don't have to implement anything . Yeah , right . Cool ! Mm - hmm . Yeah . OK . Just a drive up . Ca - chuk ! There you go . Exactly . Drive through , yeah . OK . OK . Mm - hmm . Sure . Yeah . Yeah . Oh , so in Switzerland . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . Yeah . Pretty soon . OK . Right . Yeah . Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah . Yeah , oh yeah . Yeah . OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer , so . OK . Right , no faculty ! Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all , right ."
