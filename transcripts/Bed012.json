    "transcript": "Is food not allowed in here ? Alright . Just a second . I 'll be back . Oh , do I not ? The Crown ? Is that the actual name ? OK . Yes . Indeed . Yes , I have . And , I do . Yeah , alright . s So where are we ? I don't think it can handle French , but anyway . No . I 'm not drinking tea . What are you talking about ? Mm - hmm . Excuse me . Yeah . Mm - hmm . You should probably make them out of Yeah . The different decision nodes , you mean ? Well , d yeah , this is making the assumption . Yes . But I mean , why do we @ @ If we trusted the Go - there node more th much more than we trusted the other ones , then we would conclude , even in this situation , that he wanted to go there . So , in that sense , we weight them equally right now . Yeah , so , the final d decision is the combination of these three . So again , it 's it 's some kind of , uh Yeah , sure . A decision node for every possible question , you mean ? Yeah . So is Yeah . Yeah . Um , I mean , are you saying that , what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation , or are we just dealing with arbitrary language ? Is that your point ? For every question ? Like Hmm . I don't Not necessarily , I would think . I mean , it 's not based on constructions , it 's based on things like , uh , there 's gonna be a node for Go - there or not , and there 's gonna be a node for Enter , View , Approach . Yeah . @ @ I mean , in general , like , we won't just have those three , right ? We 'll have , uh , like , many , many nodes . So we have to , like So that it 's no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say . Mm - hmm . Yeah . I think that 's true . Mm - hmm . Ge - Mm - hmm . OK , right . Yeah . Yes , I mean . Sure . You do need to know I mean , to have that kind of information . Right . I guess the other thing is that um , yeah . I mean , when you 're asked a specific question and you don't even Like , if you 're asked a Where - Is question , you may not even look like , ask for the posterior probability of the , uh , EVA node , right ? Cuz , that 's what I mean , in the Bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node . So , I mean , you may not even bother to compute things you don't need . No . You can compute , uh , the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes , given some other nodes , but totally ignore some other nodes , also . Basically , things you ignore get marginalized over . Yeah . So you have to make Yeah . Yes . But I would think that 's what you want to do . Right ? Mm - hmm . Mmm . Yeah . I don't know if it would necessarily be that , uh , complicated . But , uh I mean , it w Yeah . That 's true , I guess . Yeah , so , in a way you would have that . OK , why 's that ? Mm - hmm . OK . Alright . Well , hopefully it 's fixable . It 's there 's a OK . So we can figure this out . They should come when they 're done their stuff , basically , whenever that is . So . Um , I guess , Jerry needs to enter marks , but I don't know if he 's gonna do that now or later . But , uh , if he 's gonna enter marks , it 's gonna take him awhile , I guess , and he won't be here . Nancy ? Um , she was sorta finishing up the , uh , calculation of marks and assigning of grades , but I don't know if she should be here . Well or , she should be free after that , so assuming she 's coming to this meeting . I don't know if she knows about it . Is she ? OK . OK . Four inputs . Those are The bottom things are inputs , also . Yeah . Alarm in the dog ? Yeah . Sorry . Yeah , I 'm confusing two . Right . Maybe . Yeah . We 'll meet next Tuesday , I guess . Which Friday ? OK . Is he How long is he gone for ? Italy , huh ? What 's , uh what 's there ? Pasta . Right . Just visiting . It 's a pretty nice place , in my brief , uh , encounter with it . Yes . h What ? Which Which ones ? Um , what do you mean ? If the Go - there says No , then the Go - there is I don't u understand . Like , the Go - there depends on all those four things . Yeah . Well , it depends on the situation . If the discourse is strongly indicating that Oh , I see . The d See , uh , specifically in our situation , D and O are gonna be , uh Yeah . Sure . So , whatever . Johno ? Yeah . People have the same problem with my name . Oops . Oh , in my name ? Before the A . People have the inverse problem with my name . Yeah . That 's good . I appreciate that . \" Basman \" ? Yeah , it 's because of the chessplayer named Michael Basman , who is my hero . Not Eva ? Yeah . It doesn't matter what those nodes are , anyway , because we 'll just make the weights \" zero \" for now . OK . Sure . I mean Well But how many constructions do could we possibly have nodes for ? No , we . Like , when people do this kind of thing . Yeah . Is it considered to be like in are they considered to be like very , uh , sort of s abstract things ? OK , so it 's like in the thousands . OK . S Discourse - level constructions . Yes . How 's that ? How it can be finite , again ? But , I mean , in the practical sense , it 's impossible . Yeah . Well , two to the power of the number of neurons . Um , yeah , but there 's , like , a certain level of Bandw - Yeah , so you can't do better than something ."
