This is transcript L two nine five . nine three five , eight four two , O six six nine , three zero , three nine , four O , eight eight , five eight five one O seven , four , s five six one five four one six , six , one two five two seven eight five , nine , eight four two three five nine nine , O seven two nine , six three two zero one , one one eight , five five , O one eight , one one six eight three , six , eight nine six Just to save time . Does matter for them . We could . We might . Not not rehearse , I mean , I have just not spent any time on it , so I can show you what I 've got , get your input on it , and maybe some suggestions , that would be great . And the same is true for the proposal . I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains . So , um . I don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it because but you could always send me comments per electronic mail and they will be incorporated . Um , the It basically says , well \" this is construal \" , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules how things are construed , and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what in our beloved tourism domain . But , with a focus on @ @ Hmm ? Um , I don't I , uh I don't need it . Um , actually this is the the newest version after your comments , and Yeah . Yep . Yeah , um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d current formalism thing that you presented . But for this it doesn't matter . But , uh Hmm ! And And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or readability Hmm ? Interesting . Twenty - ninth . The twenty - ninth . That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea . OK ? Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here and so of course , I 'm I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning The Cave Forty - Five is a is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that that time . And so they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? Uh , which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . And so forth . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . Um , and so forth and so forth . That 's sort of motivating it . Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , um , um , SmartKom stuff , that we did , um , everth That 's the not the construction parser . That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser , and the generation outputter . That 's done . You have to change those strategies , right ? That 's , ten words ? Twelve ? OK . And , um , and Fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak . That 's all about that . Then I 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about uh , actually I have an example , probably . Two s Can you hear that ? Or should I turn the l volume on . Mm - hmm . But they 're they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer , the you can observe that all the time , they 're trying to match their prosody onto the machine . Yeah , you have to OK . And so forth and so forth . Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um , I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , but I thought it would interesting to , uh , um , point out that it 's basically the same . Um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from , uh , some first , uh , observations . Then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz , uh how to get there , what actually is happening there today , and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit as much as I can about the NTL story . I I wa I do wanna , um I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in , um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , and then , talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude , I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy . And , um , Srini was gonna send me some slides but he didn't do it , so from but I have the paper , I can make a resume of that , and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think . I think that 's Bergen , Chang , something , or the other . Um , and that 's now I 'm not going to bring that . So that 's basically what I have , so far , and the rest is for airplanes . So X - schemas , then , I would like to do talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes - net . End of story . Anything I forgot that we should mention ? Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . Should I mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ? \" Future activities \" something . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I I I do have it here . Um . And , of course , you know , the the big picture is this bit . But , you know , it would But I don't think I I am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know , it would be nice to tell people how what 's happening there , plus how the , uh , language learning stuff works , but Yeah , th that that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide , so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy , one of Nancy 's st Uh , I yeah , but I also have stuff you trash you left over , your quals and your triple - AI . Well , I I don't feel bad about it at all because because you are on the , uh , title . I mean on the the , you 're that 's see , that 's you . Hmm ? Propagated ? I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , so . Because , um , EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig . So it It 's on biocomputation . Would Yeah . Well , the the offices are actually a little the , think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes , and the offices are in in the glass half - dome . Uh , as a model . But I th Yeah , if somebody has something to say . Oh , in the presentation here . I was ac actually worried about bibtex . Uh . No , that 's quite possible . That 's copy and paste from something . Uh , it did , there is a reference to Srini Mm - hmm . Yeah , mmm . Um . Um , but I I did not focus on that aspect but , um Ehhh , um , it 's just underneath , uh , um , that reference to metaphor . So it 's the last paragraph before two . So on page two , um , the main focus But that 's really Yeah . Why . Mm - hmm . No , it doesn't say it at all . No . Even though One could argue what if there are basic cases , even . I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free . But \" walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , \" and \" walked into the cafe and broke his nose , \" that 's sort of Mmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yep . Yep . No . Mm - hmm . Yep . You don't find that usage , uh uh , I checked for it in the Brown national corpus . The \" walk into it \" never really means , w as in walked smack Yeah , but , y y if you find \" walked smacked into the cafe \" or \" slammed into the wall \" Mm - hmm . Right . Yeah . Or you can run into an old friend , or run . Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen , today . Not not your marks . Well , Well there actually the i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this , uh , from our domain . So maybe if we w if we can make one up now , that would be c incredibly helpful . How w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the to the domain . Mm - hmm . I had two hours w with George on this , so it , um Um . \" On the bus \" is a m is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on on that path and th w I mean it 's he there 's a platform notion , right ? \" he 's on the standing on the bus waving to me . \" But th the regular as we speak \" J Johno was on the bus to New York , \" um , uh , he 's that 's , uh , what did I call it here , the transportation schema , something , where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight , and you can be , you know , on the wagon . Yeah . But it 's it 's unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say . So . Yeah . But um . So in terms of the this We had we had initially we 'd started discussing the \" out of film . \" And there 's a lot of \" out of \" analysis , so , um , could we capture that with a different construal of So running running out of something is different from being out of somewhere . Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it . Yeah . Mm - hmm . There 's gonna be four computational linguists , computer it 's More there 's going to be the just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists . Oh , the thesis ! That 's that 's computa should be very computational , and , uh , someth I mean the the old bakery example might be nice , \" Is there a bakery around here \" . So if you c we really just construe it as a No , it 's the bakery itself is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ? And then Mmm . No . Where is the castle ? How old is it ? How much does it cost ? S But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus . Huh . Well , I mean , my argument here is it 's it 's it 's the same thing as \" Plato 's on the top shelf , \" I 'm con you know , th that you can refer to a book of Plato by using \" Plato , \" and you can refer back to it , and so you can Castles have as tourist sites , have admission fees , so you can say \" Where is the castle , how much does it cost ? \" Um . \" How far is it from here ? \" So , You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so , www . Mm - hmm . Well , I I I Well I when , uh just f u the data that I 've looked at so far that rec I mean , there 's tons of cases for polysemy . So , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build you know , whatever . Um , so ib in mus for example , in museums , you know , as a building or as something where pictures hang versus , you know , ev something that puts on exhibits , so forth . But Um . Hmm ? Yeah , well No , but this that 's what I have , you know , started doing . Metonymy , polysemy . But I think the argument should be uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical , construal still is , uh , you know , completely , um , key in terms of finding out any of these things , so , um . We , uh I with a I looked with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy . Hardly anything . So not even in descriptions w did we find anything , um , relevant . But OK this is just something we 'll we 'll see , um , and deal with . I mean maybe the \" where is something \" question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request . So , if we 're not talk about the lexic instruction . Yeah . Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level , that 's sort of one level higher . But I don't need it . Mm - hmm . Also it would be nice to get ultimately to get a nice mental space example , so , even temporal references are just in the spatial domain are rare . When when you 're getting information on objects . So , I mean Yeah . Yeah , maybe we can include that also in our second , uh , data run . We c we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth ."
