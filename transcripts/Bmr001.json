    "transcript": "OK , so we 're live . Are we live or are we Memorex ? Right . So . Is that alright ? OK . Yep . Yeah , both channels . Although the gain is pretty low . So for the um read numbers task , I have extracted these OK . Right and I 'm now talking on microphone number two , uh , the wireless microphone number two . I 'm Actually , i Yes , it 'll be pretty horrible . So , what I have on these forms here is for the read numbers read digits tasks and it 's extracted directly from Aurora and uh So what I was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading reading the numbers on the form . Fill it out . No , you don't need to . So that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing . W Why don't you want to fill it out right now ? Just so that OK . And so you have to be sure to pause between each line , since we 're going to be segmenting it and then doing it that way . OK . So , Adam Janin next , uh transcript number two on a wireless headset number two . two seven O three six seven four five seven one nine zero eight five nine eight zero seven four three seven O zero nine nine five one So I definitely wasn't pausing enough between them . That 'll be an issue . Yep . Mm - hmm ! Right and that that included a fair amount of fiddling around , since it 's it 's more or less the first time we 've tried to do it . I mean , ev eventually we 'll want to like tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't aren't people aren't tripping over the wires and so on . Right . Do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that ? Well , I I can help them get done um one question is budget . Do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that . Well , I think our intention at this point is when we 're not using it to record a meeting we 'll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on . So . Right . Not have it Well , ultimately we 're gonna need to build one anyway . Sure . Because we we 're gonna have to put it in a PDA . Right ? If we have microphones in a PDA it 's gonna need bias and a pre - amp . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . You you mean for noise cancelling , or ? Do they mean omnidirectional , is that their point ? I mean all the noise cancelling mikes , they 're you know , they 're a few m millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions . But . Oh , I see . It 's Oh , OK , so they 're not talking about how far apart the mikes are , they 're talking about how far they are from the speaker . Hmm . Do they believe you can get speaker location out of it ? Cuz that 's that 's one way we could sneak it in . Well . Oh , you mean for location ? OK . Depends on who 's working on it . Yeah , right . but someone has to write some software to to actually do it . Someone might . Oh that 's uh I was just thinking one thing we may wanna do is put the fake PDA right in front of someone instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now . on the thought that my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little PDA in front of us and so the acoustics uh you might want to try to match the acoustics . No , and I don't need to meet with those people . Mm - hmm . Right . Right . That 's right . Three , right ? So I guess this a pretty dense group but it it 's getting a lot higher . Well , I 'm trying to be . So . Except I s got a PDA way before Well I was doing hand I was doing wearable computers at Boeing , so I guess I sort of count . But . Mm - hmm . Well . Five with wireless . So we could have eight . Nine . Excuse me , nine . Five with wireless and four without , and four with wired . Um , we don't have headsets though . Oh , OK so we just have to c wander around and collect them up . Mm - hmm . Uh , there 's one in my office . So . So , we 'll just have to see if that works . Right and also I would like to work out some of the software issues a little more completely . So , um , you know , we 're gonna want to resample and con and bring them over to another machine and uh um organize the how we 're gonna store it all . It was more than that . We said , four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else . And then we cut in half , by That 's forty minutes So , six gigabytes . Yeah . I came out at the gig an hour , at one point . That that 's one computation I did for sixteen channels , sixteen bit . Is it two gig an hour ? I 'm off by an order of magni That 's alright . Order of two . Factor of two . How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space cuz it I mean it 's a nine gig drive and there 's four gig on sc on scratch and there 's about three gig unused , it looked like , on the home directory . I just don't know enough about LINUX . How hard is it to repartition ? It 's a pain . Mm - hmm . Right . So I 've I 've already created a \" U U , doctor speech , data , MR \" directory , or had Jane do it and uh um but there 's not a lot of free space around . So it it it has currently about four gig on the drive that I think she 's going to put it on um . And so we need we definitely need to go buy uh you know forty gig fifty gig of drive drive space . That 's true . I hadn't even thought about that , although it 'd be kind of interesting . Yeah , it 's pretty horrible . Yeah so it might be four . Right ? But it wouldn't be sixteen . But that 's a separate training . No wait . More disk is better . Absolutely . I mean my my preference would be to get get ourselves a hundred gig of disk . And just not bother . And back up . Right , then it doesn't need to be backed up . Yeah , we were talking about that . I 'm not sure if anyone 's still using it . I 'll send mail to speech local . I 'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone 's still using it . So that would last us for a while . Well , right now we don't have any choice . It r still records all sixteen channels . It 's just most of them are all zeroes . So that that 's on our list too . Yep . It 's mostly a question of user interface . How do we how do we specify which ones are on ? Yeah , so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way do we ? So these large sections when you guys aren't talking Run what on those ? OK . Yeah , so , P Z Ms . Yeah . Yeah , it 's something that that we definitely need to look at with this . Maybe we shouldn't 've subsampled it down to sixteen bits for our first try . Right . Yeah , so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P Z Ms are better than the middle sixteen bits . Regardless , yeah . W I was just noticing on the on the there 's a view meter , software view meter and the PZM gain is real low . So . Yeah . Yep . Yeah , that 's right . We 've got lots of bits of noise . Right the other other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here . You know , I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output . Oh , it 's just not working . OK . Yeah , that way we don't we can't listen to it on this machine . Right . And we 've looked at it so we know it 's working . I mean , you can see the little squiggles , and it looks like speech so You just can't listen . Right . OK . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Well right I I just did ten per page I could easily do twenty per page . It 's just a question of uh of how much uh annoyance I wanted to put uh people going to meetings through . Mm - hmm . Sure . Us , to begin with . I think that 's the intention . Well , I think I think , um , certainly us , Meeting Recorder . Um , us other groups . It just depends on how many meetings we 're we 're having . Um . Jerry also said it would be he would be willing to have his group , some of the AI meetings do it as well . And uh Exactly exactly . I think there are enough incidental meetings for us to to do this . And if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough , um , then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well . Which I 'm interested in . I mean , that 's one of the things , the whole reason I want a PDA as opposed to a wired room is for spontaneous meetings . Right . That 's right . That 's why I put ten on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty . Right . Well , I I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times , just for the novelty . Oh , that 's a good point ! Boy , that 's abs I had never I hadn't even thought about that . Oh , man ! Maybe we should have the reading group here and force Jane to come . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I mean it 's a different style . But I think that 's alright . Um , we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones Um , I had another question briefly about transcription . So are we going get an external service or are we gonna do it ? I mean who 's gonna generate the transcripts ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . Yeah , the the problem of course is that it 's you know , in in this meeting it 's three four five six seven eight , it 's nine transcripts , potentially . Oh , you 're right , yeah , yeah , yeah . Right . So the only thing we 'll have to be careful with is that they 're well , what are they listening to ? They 're going to have to make speaker assignments , and wh and which recording are they gonna listen to ? Oh , that would be interesting . Mm - hmm . Yeah . OK . Mm - hmm . Yet . So that I mean , that 's one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is gonna be another chunk of work . Um . Mm - hmm . Right . Mm - hmm . Yeah , one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field and we do an initial recognition pass , is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript , if the near field mike does a reasonably good job ? I bet it isn't , unless it 's really close to right . Right . Some errors , yeah . Not in Scotland . Not in Scotland . They they sheep they s they they speak cheap English , right ? Sure . Mm - hmm . Right . And then do some segmenting and recognition initial recognition would be interesting to do . That 's what I mean . Yeah just doing a digits on it uh , connected digits . You wanna read ? This is Adam on uh wireless headset number two with transcript number five . three four O six five two six seven four eight five four nine O zero one zero eight eight five three three seven one Oh I on I did ten but I can I have a script to generate them automatically . OK . That 's why , yep . This is Adam on the wireless headset , transcript eight . five five two zero six seven O O seven six eight nine eight nine O zero two two eight two O three four eight four seven zero Go ahead . OK , go ahead and read it and then fill it out . OK ."
