    "transcript": "I think that 's recording now . Um , do it again . That 's uh That 's in channel one . Channel one . Let me make sure . There are no There 's only one connection element . It 's zero - based . Unfortunately the mikes are you know This this has the disadvantage of needing to put the numbers on the mikes . Consistently not equal to the numbers numbers on the channels . Well , you can write it down . I mean Write down whatever you like . I don't know . You can do whatever any way you like . The weird thing is that um it means that it varies when you move your head around but I think it 's probably the better solution . OK ? Do we have the numbers ? the the sheets , that we did from last time ? so we can do them again ? Great . I 'm on uh mike three . This is mike three , coming in here . It 's moving around as I move my head backwards and forwards . So that 's just the way it goes . That 's life . That 's just what it does . That 's right . OK . P Z Ms ? or or not P Z Ms ? Because this is PZM number three . Let 's list them in order . PZM number three was the furthest away . This is the next one in , which is PZM number four , apparently . PZ - What - Can you can you see other stuff happening ? This is PZM number four . which is closest to the machine room . I mean I don't know . It 's all hopeless . This is uh one side of PDA , I guess . We could actually give these sides names , right ? This would be left , wouldn't it . I know , but I 'm just asking . I wasn't asking you . This is this is PDA left . You getting something there ? And this is PDA right . They will vary in future . Because it depends which one of these shows more consistency then . No . Well , we 're w we 're so ahead of the game now , cuz we 've got built - in downsampling now . We 've got built - in downsampling . And so it 's only recording sixteen kilohertz data , and we 've got We 're not select We 're not recording the empty channels . What about the ones that we didn't record ? OK ? Fine . Then it doesn't matter , does it . Before that . OK . So , this is Dan on mike three , wireless headset , I 'm wearing it around my neck . which may be different than wearing it on the head . And the transcript is one fifty - one to one seventy . eight one nine two two six O nine seven zero one two three five one seven one four two six six four six seven six one one eight seven two four six three seven nine O zero zero two one three three eight four four eight one five five six seven eight seven And Great . OK . It 's kind of weird . That was great , what you did . Um Yeah , cuz I figure no one 's going to be able to figure it out from the from my name . So , Yeah . Oh , right , right , right . @ @ Well , hang on . Well , Well , I guess . Do you So , do you What are what are we talking about ? That you 're gonna you 're gonna do transcriptions ? You 're going to listen to these things and OK . D I And do you have a clear I mean , is that Do you sort of Are you going to have to make up what you do or do you have a very clear idea of what you 're going to do ? So I mean , is it is it Is this l Is it like something you 've done before ? or Yeah . And , Yeah . Yeah , because as people are going to be listening to it afterwards and saying \" Oh listen to her . She couldn't even speak true English sentences ! \" Oh , you 're meant You 're meant to speak naturally . You 're meant to say \" Oh , I didn't realize we were being recorded ! \" It 's just It 's just jewelry . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . The problem is The nice thing about transcribers is they have foot pedals , Oh . I see . I I I actually have one . Well , Sarah has one because she does a lot of transcribing of interviews . But The crazy thing is we 'd have to convert the s we 'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette . to use it . I mean , given that we 've already got them digitally it would be you know , it 's quite tempting to use some kind of uh software thing . But but then there 's the question of the ergonomic interface , that OK . What do they connect to ? Oh , that 's totally cool . now how how do you how do you decide which keystrokes they generate ? Hmm . And this is Windows ? Uh - huh . So hang on . You have You have these foot pedals but you d you 're not using them . Yeah . Wow . That 's so cool . OK . Well , the d the well , the uh The part that 's not wonderful is someone has to write the software . Yeah . Right . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Well , Yeah , absolutely . Yeah . What 's her name ? OK . Uh - huh . So Oh , OK . So , the p I mean , what I 'm hearing is that the problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts is kind of I mean , it 's not a it 's not an unfamiliar problem . So that So that I mean that basically , there are standard solutions and we should just adopt adopt them and it 's going to cost however much it 's going to cost , I mean there 's We 're we 're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in bringing down the cost cuz probably the low cost solution 's already been established . And so that 's just whatever it is . That 's how we 'll do it . See what I mean ? Mm - hmm . Uh - huh . Yeah . Well , whatever they people who have had to do this I mean the only thing is I wonder if our requirements are different from um I mean there 's than than what 's been done in the past than discourse analyzers because maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align you know , how much time aligned detail we need and uh how much detail in terms of people . I don I don't know how much ti I don't think we do need any time aligned detail . I think we just have basically one text file which runs from beginning to end . But . Sure . But not if it costs more . Mm - hmm . Right . Yeah . Right , I mean , the it 's sort of it 's a little In some sense it 's a little bit easier with it with Switchboard because the telephone is so actually people are less flexible in what they do . In this kind of situation where we 've got nonverbal channels then there 's a lot of overlap and there 's just that it 's not a very good model . Well , every utterance is a single speaker , right ? It 's just that utterances can overlap . I mean , I think so . I think I think I mean , I think when I 'm when Like , So , Eric made a s made a sentence , and that should be like one utterance and then I had a couple of backchannels in there and they should be just overlapping things that I don't think that we should break Eric 's sentences for those . I think Well , we 'll have to go in from somewhere but we can't necessarily I mean , we we may be able to get the transcriber to give them to us if we give them software but we may not in which case we 'll have to get them some other way , like with forced alignment later , I mean you know all this can be done . Yeah . Phoneme phoneme phoneme transcriptions . Yeah . There 's a there are there 's a whole bunch of tools . There 's a some web page , where they have a list of like ten of them or something . No , no , no . There 's some I mean , I just there are there are a lot of a lot of @ @ these things . Oh , EAGLES . Yeah , that 's the European one . Yeah . Mmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Right . You don't Just take the thing with you . Well , I don't know what will happen , but you may as well . Sure . Sure . Sure . My uh My s Yeah , so be just Yeah . Yeah , that 's true . You can leave it behind as well if you want . I I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing , right ? So they probably will have tools to address the actual the the the transcriber support and then automated alignment of what the transcribers give you , which is , you know , exactly the problem we have . So . Right . Right . But then again we don't have to do it . and Oh sure , we are . We 've got individual microphones . Yeah . Yeah . Well , Yes , although that might @ @ presumably we 'll have one we 'll have several formats that you can interconvert between . When we want to do recognition we 'll do STM , but if we 're rather than rather than designing our own format , we 'll just take whatever comes out of the tools that we can find to use , I think . I I I 've got no idea what that 'll look like . but on our speaker phones . Right . Mmm - hmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm . OK . Good . Right . Oh , good . It must be It must be fundable then . Yeah . Oh , yeah . @ @ Alembic ? No . Mm - hmm . I don't think so . Mm - hmm . Hmm . Mm - hmm . Because the transcriber 's put in intonational tags ? Or maybe not . Well . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Who 's it from ? Right . Is it the French one ? U Penn . I think that I 've heard of this one . It was the one that Steve Renals mentioned . Sure . Can I see ? Well Well , We are going to do time alignment . but we 'll probably do it ourselves , right ? So we 're not we 're not concerned about getting getting about buying and or bringing in tools . We 're not very good but we 're proud of ourselves . We 're very proud of our time alignment . Right . I mean , it 's not a bad Oh look ! It uses Snack ! Um . It uses Snack . That 's a TCL audio thing that I had some involvement with . Yeah . If I have to use it I 'm sure I 'm sure It 's a TCL - based thing . I 'm sure it 's just wonderful . Yes , T \" Transcriber was developed with the scripting language TCL TK and C extensions . It relies on the Snack sound extension , which allows support for most common audio formats . \" Yeah . It 's the French one . I mean , no , I I But I 've never downloaded it . Someone mentioned it to me . And that 's probably why they mentioned it to me , because they thought I would be excited because it 's TCL - based . Oh \" Deliverable D - three point one \" , Oh yeah . Transcriber Mmm . Mm - hmm . That 's a fine question . Wow . So this thing , this uh deliverable D - three point one of the MATE project is a review of a lot of different tools . They 're actually , they seem to be more the tool the main focus of the tools is you 've already got a transcription but you 're trying to tag the different turns transi transcriptions with uh discourse roles and things like that . But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well . And I could be wrong . Right . I Uh , the stuff I did , I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs , listened to them in stereo . And I was very impressed by how well you could hear separate speakers , but I haven't I haven't done very extensive tests . you get a certain amount of spatial information . It 's not It 's not consistent but it 's Gives you some noise Yeah , yeah , you 'd get get wide coverage . Right . Right . But I mean But you would you would You know , you 'd get good You 'd get good pick up at both ends of the table . So . Well , what is what is the goal ? again ? We 're going to end up with some I mean , ultimately , we 're going to end up with transcriptions of these meetings . What , and then Then Then we 'll be done , huh ? Um . Of course , there are different kinds of recos so we 're going to actually train a recognizer based on these uh , far - field mikes cuz what we that 's the problem we 're trying to solve . OK . We need a lot of I mean Well and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately . Um . Yeah . Yeah . Close mikes . I mean I yeah , I feel like that What we 're actually going to do with these data is very unclear to me Well , because I don't think that 's a That 's not going to work . Right ? OK . We 're going to get horrible performance on that . Uh - huh . Yeah . Well , we know the answer to that , but unfortunately , will we get fifty percent p accuracy ? Yeah . And are they specifically far field mikes ? OK . Yeah . Well , I mean , that would be tremendously useful information assuming that we actually pursue it , but um we 've got a huge problem , because if we ge if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data . And um it 's just eh it 's very frightening . uh - uh Who , Eric ? Outrageous ! Laying out his folders . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . Lea ? I see . Yeah . OK . If you think it won't slow you down at all . Yeah . Yeah , that 's great . No , well , presumably there 's a an annotation standard for prefix characters or something like that . That 's what they 're using here . OK . Yeah , exactly . Exactly . Exactly . Well , so , um What is the plan ? We 're gonna I mean , How many How many How many meetings ? What about r our recording schedule ? How many meetings are we going to record ? Um . Which ones are we going to transcribe ? Um . Do we OK . Absolutely . Yeah . OK . Five . Well . Uh - huh . Mm - hmm . If we can do anything with it , yeah . I don't feel like you 're speaking unnaturally quietly . I mean I feel like it 's all quite normal . Yeah . Eric 's really got it easy cuz he 's got the lapel mike , which is so unobtrusive . They 're much more expensive . I I Which I don't understand but there it is . Right , it 's because they make people feel like television stars . So you can charge more for it . Yeah , that 's it . That must be it . Yeah . OK . Well , I don't mind . Oh , we should read some more numbers , then . Are we are we are we there ? Are we at that point ? More space than you can We 've got two hours of space now . Yeah . In theory . Assuming it 's recording anything . OK , this is Dan and transcript two thirty - one to two fifty . zero seven one one two O nine one three zero one one five three zero six three five seven one zero four seven seven two three eight eight nine O zero two five three four zero four four seven five five zero three eight five four six seven eight O one nine five zero one zero seven two OK . Yep ."
