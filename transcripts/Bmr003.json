    "transcript": "OK , this is one channel . Can you uh , say your name and talk into your mike one at a time ? OK . Uh , I don't think it 's on there , Jane . Uh , I still don't see you Jane . Yeah , I s No . Uh , well , the mike isn't close enough to your mouth , so . S uh , try speaking loudly , so , OK , good . Thank you . Well , we don't wanna renumber them , cuz we 've already have like , forms filled out with the numbers on them . So , let 's keep the same numbers on them . OK , Dan , are you on ? Good . And I 'm getting lots of responses on different ones , so I assume the various and assorted P Z Ms are on . Stuff . Yeah , this is not something you need to attend . So . Besides , I don't want anyone who has a weird accent . Right , Dan ? Well , then put it on your head . What are you doing ? Well , I m I would prefer that people wore it on their head but they were complaining about it . Because it 's not it doesn't go over the ears . It 's very badly designed so it 's Yeah but , there 's nowhere to put the pad so it 's comfortable . And it feels so good that way . So I I again would like to do some digits . Um . Sure . So let me Well , you know , I 'm just that sort of digit - y g sorta guy . OK . So this is Adam . I doubt it . So this is Adam Janin on mike number one , transcript three seventy - one , three ninety , uh , wireless head mike . six eight one seven eight nine zero zero one two nine five one three eight three two seven seven three four five one five six O one O seven eight two four seven six four nine nine three five O six three four O s zero seven one one two three zero five one O six five . I think we 're session four by the way . Or m it might be five . I didn't bring my previous thing . Yeah , d leave the channel blank . Right . Uh , transcript number . Thanks . Should I turn off the VU meter Dan ? Do you think that makes any difference ? Why ? Are you gonna do something other than hit \" quit \" ? Oh . Should have done it before . The VU meter which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that the act of recording the VU meter was one of the things that contributed to the errors . That was me , I thought that was Well , the only reason that could be is if the driver has a bug . Right ? Because the machine just isn't very heavily loaded . No chance of that . Just because it 's beta . Look OK ? Yeah , we usually do that . Yeah . I mean , that 's what we 've done before . Which means we need to move this thing , and sorta decide how we 're actually going to do things . So . Right . Mmm . That 'll work . That 'll work . That 's right . OK , so , topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription . Um , I 've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services and Jane has been working on doing transcription . Uh , and so we wan wanna decide what we 're gonna do with that and then get an update on the electronics , and then , uh , maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools , and so on . Um , you know , eventually we 're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing and we should decide how we 're gonna how we 're gonna handle some of these factors . So . Hmm ? Right . Right . I mean , so we 're we 're collecting a corpus and I think it 's gonna be generally useful . I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is uh , has been done before . And so I think people will be interested in having having it , and so we will Excuse me ? Well , or something . Yeah , audio D V Ds , C Ds , you know . And and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , how do we how do we just do all that infrastructure ? Right , but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC and what does that mean to what we 've done already ? Right . So , uh , as it is , it 's sort of a ad - hoc combination of stuff Dan set and stuff I set up , which we may wanna make a little more formal . So . Right . That 's right . Yeah . I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind spending the summer up there . That would be kind of fun . Yeah . Visit my friends and spend some time Well , and then also I have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits . So I have a bunch of scripts with X Waves , and some Perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are . And if U d UW 's going to do the same thing I think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well . And what I 've done is pretty ad - hoc , um , so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard . You know , STM files , or XML , or something . What 's that ? Well they they certainly wanna collect more data . And so they 're applying , I think I B M ? Is that right ? Something like that . Um , for some more money to do more data . So we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings . They wanna do an additional hundred or so hours . So , they want a very large data set . Um , but of course we 're not gonna do that if we don't get money . So . And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room . I mean , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well , the the acoustics of this room . Including the fan . Oh , it 's enormous . All the others have been on . y Absolut - Yeah . There 's definitely Yep . High pitch hum . Wow . Yeah , just get a variety . They 're very good . Carbon monoxide poisoning ? So - Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I I wish I wish we had someone here working on adaptation because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting . You know No , software , to adapt the speech recognition . Mm - hmm . That 's true . Well that 's not good , right ? Just these . Well we can look into it . So we can get that just with , uh , media costs , is that right ? Oh . Great . So that would be yeah , that would be something to look into . So . Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it , so maybe we need to think about it a little bit . Yeah . OK , why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric ? Right . Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz , to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked . A meeting meeting meeting . Well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting . So . Um . Mm - hmm . Well , I was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the U - dub to see you know , say \" this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription \" , if nothing else . So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ? OK , so since that 's what we 're talking about . What we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this French group , called \" Transcriber \" that seems to work very well . Um , so it has a , uh , nice useful Tcl - TK user interface and , uh , Right . Yes , yeah . Right , right . So we 're we 're at this point only looking for word level . So all all so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it , and identify the speaker . And so the things we that we know that I know I want are the text , the start and end , and the speaker . But other people are interested in for example stress marking . And so Jane is doing primary stress , um , stress marks as well . Um , and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , filled pauses , and all that other sort of stuff , we have to decide how much of that we wanna do . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Well , that 's part of the thing we 're talking about . So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting 's worth , you know , forty minutes to an hour , and Yeah . Ten times about , is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take , and then also what tools we would use . And so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gonna do it ? So . R right , so so one one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it . And apparently that 's happened in the past . And I think that 's probably the right way to do it . Um , it will require a post pass , I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly , but I just can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from a commercial one . And the commercial ones I 'm sure will be much more expensive . Yeah right . We will just get Joy and Jane to do everything . But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who who need money and , uh , duh , again o I meant Joy . And so again , I have to say \" are we recording \" and then say , uh , Morgan has has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have . So . Well , if it 's zero then we can't do any transcription . I mean , cuz we 're we I mean , I I can't imagine us doing it ourselves . Right ? N right . Right . Mm - hmm . Right . Right . So at any rate , Jane was looking into the possibility of getting students , at is that right ? Talking to people about that ? OK . Yeah , right . So , uh She 's already done quite a bit . Yeah . No . We 've we 've thought about doing that but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous . Most of those are done by a person . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , we I mean , we 've talked about it but We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances . Yeah , so so what what she 's done so far , is sort of more or less breath g not breath groups , sort of phrases , continuous phrases . And so , um , that 's nice because you you separate when you do an extract , you get a little silence on either end . So that seems to work really well . Um . Hmm . We could program that pretty easily , couldn't we Dan ? Yeah , mis Mister TCL ? But , um But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID . I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change . But that would be Yeah , I guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it . But We 're gonna need we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , and validate the tools the do the d to to do all this anyway . I knew you were gonna do that . Just saw it coming . Mm - hmm . She 's she 's done about half a meeting . Right ? About half ? Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the and the other person would have to I mean that 's easy enough . I could do that . No , no . I mean , that that 's easy enough . I could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words , and time yourself on it . So . Yep . So it that might be worth doing . That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations . Right . Yep . That That 'll s it might save ninety percent of the work though . So . Yeah . I 've already become pretty familiar with the format , so it would be easy . If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ? Mm - hmm . It 's pretty cute . But at any rate . So , um , Right . So so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard . Everyone more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription . Using using stone age tools . I mean , I looked at Cyber Transcriber which is a service that you send an audio file , they do a first - pass speech recognition . And then they they do a clean up . But it 's gonna be horrible . They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this . Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price . They want you to call and and talk . So for other services , um , they were about thirty dollars an hour . Thirty So , yeah . For thirty dollars an hour for of their work . So so if it 's ten times it 's three hundred dollars an hour . No . Mm - hmm . Yeah , so so my my search was pretty cursory . It was just a net search . And , uh , so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff through that . Right . Trivial . They had two speakers over the telephone . Um , mostly because they were doing much lower level time . So they were doing phone and syllable transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription . And so we 're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that . Yep . Right . And so so what I 'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour . I think that 's the ball park . There were several different companies that and the the range was very tight for technical documents . Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour . They won't . We 'll have to mix them . Yes , it is . Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on . None of them specifically said that they would do speaker ID , or speaker change mark . They all just said transcription . Well , the the way it worked is it it was scaled . So what they had is , if it 's an easy task it costs twenty - four dollars an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time . And what they said is for the hardest tasks , bad acoustics , meeting settings , it 's thirty - two dollars an hour and it takes about ten times real time . So I think that we can count on that being about what they would do . It would probably be a little more because we 're gonna want them to do speaker marking . So . Yep , we have to have a short meeting . Stop talking ! And clearly . Content words only . So . But at any rate , so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out . Thirty or forty . Three hundred dollars an hour . Right . Right , these are linguistics grad students . Six . Mm - hmm . I mean , that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper . And also we would have control of I mean , we could give them feedback . Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount . I mean , we can't tell them , you know , \" for this meeting we really wanna mark stress and for this meeting we want \" And and they 're not gonna provide they 're not gonna provide stress , they 're not gonna re provide repairs , they 're not gonna provide they they may or may not provide speaker ID . So that we would have to do our own tools to do that . So I just I hope it 's Jane . Is that alright ? Um , I would imagine there would be some monetary involved but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it . Well , I would like you to do it because you have a lot more experience than I do , but if if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor . Yeah , six dollars an hour . OK . More . Um , any more on transcript we wanna talk about ? Um , the user interface only allows two . And so if if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two . But my script can handle any . And their save format can handle any . And so , um , using this the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want . Yeah , French . Yeah . And they 're they 've been quite responsive . I 've been exchanging emails on various issues . Yes , and they said that 's on in in the works for the next version . Multichannels was also Well , they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels . So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen . For this exact task ? I think they 're linguists . It 's also All the source is available . So . If you if you speak TCLTK . And they have they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development and I said , well , maybe . So if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in . Way . Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog So I mean , tho those are things we could do but I I just don't know how much it 's worth doing . I mean we 're just gonna have Hmm . Point , whatever . Non - canonical . Comments . Well , I think what w what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech , right ? Yep . Yeah , there 's an overlapping mark . Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end . Huge amounts . Um , when when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , and we 're all sort of separated , and and doing things . But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap but it it 's marked pretty clearly . Um , some of the backchannel stuff Jane had some comments and but I think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting . And so I think that that often often you can't tell . I mean , Jane had had comments like uh , to who who the person was speaking to . Yeah . Yeah , but someone who , uh , was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that . Or when Dan said , \" I wa I wasn't talking to you \" . You have to turn off your mike . Mm - hmm . But but when you w when you listen to it Well what what it what happens is if you 're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total totally impolite . Um But but if you knew that that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , it it became OK . So . Yes . Right . Stereo . Yeah . Oh . I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other . I have a auto - gain - mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal and that seems to work really well for the uh transcribers . I I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end . We should probably mark areas that have no speakers as no speaker . Then , so question mark colon is fine for that . Just say silence . No one 's talking . Yep . Well , I wanna leave the marked I don't want them to be part of another utterance . So you just you need to have the boundary at the start and the end . It can read and write as many as you want , it 's just that it Right , i it 's I didn't explain it well . If we use the the little the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention . Right . Yes . Right . It 's just user interface . So i it 's the the the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that stuff , handles multiple speakers . It 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple any more than two . Yep . Yep . Yep . Yep . Oh . So - Especially for meetings . I mean , if i if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . You know , if you were trying to do a remembrance agent . But I think for meetings it 's probably alright . But , a lot of these issues , I think that for uh , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter . But other people have other interests . So . Right . Well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ? Is that something you want to do , Dan ? No . But I think for a first try that 's about right . If we hire an infinite number of Dan 's Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way ? OK , good . No . Dan 's sort of already started . Can we sell banner ads ? What a good idea , that 's how we could pay for the transcription . Hey , what about me ? We can do it all . And we have we have quite a disparate number of web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around . I have several and Dan has a few , and Yep . Try try to s consolidate . I mean , who wants to do that though ? No one wants to do that . So . Yeah , I own the project but I don't wanna do it . It 's mine ! All mine ! \" Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . \" Yeah , I I 'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that that is legible , and pleasant to read , and up to date , and et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . Absolutely . It 's it 's absolutely against the law to use a tool . I haven't found any tools that I like . It 's just as easy to use to edit the raw HTML as anything else . It 's obviously not true . Now , I guess if I were if I were doing more powerful excuse me more complex web sites I might want to . But most of the web sites I do aren't that complex . But . I think both . Mostly in house . OK , well , send me links and I wi send me pointers , rather , and I 'll put it together . Yep . OK , um , let 's move on to electronics . Yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ? It 's great . Clink ! Clink ! And and crinkle them and Yes . He is . Absolutely . Get your paper off my PDA ! Yeah . Right . Well , we wanna do that definitely . So . Sleeve . Oh . OK , not just sleeve them all ? And leave them loose ? Whoo ! Speed - A \" sleeping policeman \" ! Cool . Oh . That 's really cruel . OK , so that So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ? Well , OK , let me rephrase that . Why two each ? OK . OK . Alright . Right . OK . But then none of these . Right . N none of these and no P Z Ms then . Oh , I didn't understand Oh , I see , I see . So so you 'd imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ? Mm - hmm . Oh , then it comes on . I see , I see . OK , good . Mm - hmm . Right . You g And did it work ? Did it sound good ? Wow . So what 's the schedule on these things ? Mm - hmm . So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up so that it 's a little more presentable and organized . And I 'm I 'm just not sure what that is . I mean , some sort of cabinet . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I understand . So . I need a desk at home too , alright ? Is that gonna be a better solution than just going out and buy one ? Mm - hmm . And it 's total crap . Right , Kleenex and telephones . Um , so yeah , I g I guess it 's just a question , is that something you wanna spend your time on ? OK , great . Hmm ? Mm - hmm . Lax . I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer . So , um , j uh , then the other question is do we wanna try to do a user interface that 's available out here ? A user interface . I mean , do we wanna try to get a monitor ? Or just something . And how do we want to do that ? J just so we see something . I have an IRAM machine I 've borrowed and we can use it . Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ? Well We jus Right . Um , right , so it 's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem . To Mac . Airport . The question is , is there an Apple driver ? Right . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Right . I 've I 've borrowed the IRAM VAIO Sony thingy , and I don't think they 're ever gonna want it back . So . Sure . But that does mean so we can use that as well . I had I had actually earlier asked if I could borrow one of the cards to do wireless stuff and they said , \" sure , whenever you want \" . So I think it won't be a problem . Yep . PC card . Right , I mean , and if and if his doesn't work , as I said , we can use the PC . Good . So So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ? Great . They 're flashing ! When people talk , it they go on and off . Cheap . A PC and a peanuts . Yeah . Good . Well , actually shorten There 's a speech compression program that works great on things like this , cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits . And so most of the time no one 's talking so it shortens it dramatically . But if you talk quieter , the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better . So . Probably . Shorter words . How about if you just go \" uh \" ? How do you spell that ? OK , can you do one more round of digits ? Are we done talking ? Do we have more to talk about ? Are you done ? I 'm done . I 'll I 'll remember to bring M and M 's next time . This is Adam Janin on the wireless lapel , mike number one , transcript five thirty - one , five fifty . two three O seven nine four five O three eight five two three seven one zero eight three two seven eight six Excuse me . eight three two seven eight two six nine four two nine one O six two nine three zero one two s zero six six four one six seven four seven eight five five one six eight two six five seven seven eight eight nine six five three nine O one two nine two three seven eight six . It 's harder at the end than at the beginning . I should have mentioned that s uh , to pause between lines but It 's it 's only a hard time for the transcriber not for the speech recognizer . Me . Ugh ! I didn't know that . I should have randomized it . Because Right . If we have it , uh we don't have to transcribe . We don't have to tran Yeah , please . Bet we could do it . Actually , this I got this directly from another training set , from Aurora . So . We can compare directly . What ? Great . OK , the mike 's off . Thank you all ."
