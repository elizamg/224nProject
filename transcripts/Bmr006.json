    "transcript": "That is weird . It 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something . Next time you get it maybe we should write it down . Well , great . Great . What a deal . No crunchy food . \" Beep . \" Oh , that 's a good idea . What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? See you . Where did you copy it to ? Oh , on the tape . Ah ! Wow ! Generating a clone ? Oh ! Oh ! Hunh ! Is there a difference in price or something ? Oh ! Mm - hmm . Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , Aurora data and , um , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE . And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data . So I moved that , and then um , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . before I actually deleted the old stuff , um , but I haven't heard back yet . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk . And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff . I have to meet with , uh , Stephane to do that . So . Is that the one that has is that DC ? OK , I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we OK , DC . Yeah . So should , um One question I had for you was , um , we need we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? OK . Right . Right . Do you know what happen to know what disk that is off ? OK . Yeah . OK . Alright , I 'll find out from you . OK . Wow ! Mmm . These will be assigned by hand ? Based on the Uh - huh . You need truth . Hmm . So you 're not using all of the data . Is is Is your silence category pure silence , or ? What if there was a door - slam or something ? Pure silence . OK . You have your own ? Oh ! Oh ! What 's it written in ? Ah . I 've got a question . Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question , but w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ? I mean Uh - huh . Is that not allowed with this project ? But I didn't mean I w Given given the goal . I mean , is is that violation of the Mm - hmm Right . Right . OK . I see . OK . No , it 's not it 's not that so much as Well , it 's - I don't I don't know ho I would guess But th I don't think that matters , though . Right . So it 's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is . What looked different ? Did - Sorry , b uh I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . He was looking at the two OK . Uh - huh . OK . OK . So so if there 's two If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work . Yes . Once you got two Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? You know ? That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Didn't they have something at Cape ? Uh . Oh ! I saw a demo . Yeah . And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . That is cool . No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . Ooo ! Network ! I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then Yeah ! Hats ? Shirts . Are they new ? Oh . We still have to do this , too , right ? Digits ? I don't Right , you don't wanna do that . Yeah . Well \" The person who 's doing the transcript \" The IBM people ? They 're just gonna write \" Bob \" on it or do @ @ They can't do that . That would be hard . Mm - hmm . But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting Or , you I think said , you know , or s Liz , said something about um , uh , \" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? \" I mean , how would you say that ? I mean , you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef Yeah . Yeah . I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else . Right . Yeah . I I think the I think I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . Why ? I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two Why do you have to know his name ? Yeah . Yeah . OK . Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word \" Jose \" in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded . Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know Mm - hmm . But if you release both But if both of those are publically available Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , and then , we wouldn't have to worry about it . Mister White . But so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous What did it sound like ? What ? Transcript one six three one dash one six five zero . five O seven two eight five nine eight six eight seven O eight three O nine one one zero eight four one two O four three five two six five eight seven seven two seven eight nine O O eight O three one three one two six three three four seven one five I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations . like as if you were talking like , \" nine eight six eight seven ? \" Oh , really . So they were like looking ahead , huh ? Yeah , yeah . Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this They may as well throw in some interesting intonations ."
