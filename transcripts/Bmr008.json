    "transcript": "Or , I like it , also , like this . So you see the So . I should have brought more I have a couple things about speaker form about forms in general . Stuff . OK . I uh probably should have printed out more of these . So one of the things that I 've been doing with the digits forms is I 've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them and it 's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time . So , what I thought was , it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once . And then , on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form . so , I had a first pass of it , and I spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify what language and education and that sort of stuff and so I have a first pass at it . And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it . And I only did one copy which was really stupid of me . um So I 'll just sort of say what it 's on and then I can hand it around . So the top of it is uh , Name , Sex Email or Other Contact Information . And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name , so that you can distinguish them , and then also just to have a separate contact from the consent form . And then , uh , we talked a little bit about whether to do how we get at the background . And we could do profession , but it 's so uniform that we figured what was more important was actually the education level . um At least that would get at some idea of their background . So I have a And s and relevant to status . So that what I have is uh So uh , I have uh , five things that you can circle , Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , and then Other , with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there 's some Other . So I think the problem with that is that there 's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors , who are not used to the US education levels . and may need some help to translate what that means . Mm - hmm . Well , the problem with that is um , I think the same as the problem of profession . That it it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down \" speech researcher \" or or something at that granularity . So I don't think there 's a problem asking the education level , I th At least I don't feel like there is . um I think the only question is whether the what categories should there be . Less . Right . Well , one of the one of the criteria I had for designing this form , is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet . And so we 'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also . Is I did not want to have to , you know come down and quiz each person and have a uh social dynamics expert being the one who 's filling out the answers . I want it to be self - evaluating . You can give it to them and they can understand what you 're asking . Yep . That 's a separate question . So , we 'll We 'll get to that in a moment . And this particular form I know . So , this particular form is speaker is dependent only on the speaker , not on the meeting . You could imagine then having another form that you might want to do during a meeting to get out the relationships But then that 's interfering with the meeting . So , what I like about this information is you give it to them once , and they fill it out once , and and then you have that information . Not at all . I mean , the fact that one person 's an undergrad and the other 's a full professor is interesting . So , the question is how much of this information um , can y Well , absolutely ! But but you want to have that information . Right ? So , if you don't have that information , how are you gonna do anything ? I mean , so what would you suggest ? Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , Other oh , that 's right , you know I was saying \" Professor \" . Uh - huh . Yeah , when I said \" Professor \" , I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more \" PHD but not Post - doc \" . and Or maybe Post - doc change \" Post - doc \" to \" PHD \" ? Because I think PHD and Professor are d are distinct aren't they ? Someone who has a PHD . So , maybe Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD and Other ? um , other If i Instead of instead of instead of Professor or instead of Post - doc ? So , as I said Undergrad Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other ? Right . Well , the whole reason that I 'm doing it this way is is uh my experience so far has been the exact reverse . That Right . I guess we could have another type of form for less frequent . Well I think that if if we 're planning to do that , then we should probably have another set of forms . You know , a single form that 's the consent form and the speaker information form and not have them do digits . This is a topic I want to bring up after I get through this . So , that that that 's another form that I want to discuss . um , with the digits forms . So , s can we get Mm - hmm . That 's what I want to talk about in a Yeah , I 'm I have that as a topic , also . So , let 's finish with the speaker form speaker form and then we 'll get over o get over to that one . So , Education Level , Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other . OK ? um and then I put \" Optional \" with a big \" Optional \" in parentheses , Age . Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down . So I don't want to make them feel like they have to . Uh , sure . But if someone doesn't want to write it down I don't want them to say you can't record me Well , I think that just having on the form saying Optional , Age , again means I don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time we do this . And having a little instruction sheet and say \" If you 're in this age range do this , and if you 're in this rage do that . \" So . Yeah , right . Mm - hmm . Well , I think maybe that 's because no one here is sensitive about their age . But , I would rather let them leave it blank than lie . So that 's why I want to put That 's why I want to put s \" Optional , Age \" , so that if they don't want to put it , they leave it blank . But if you put \" Optional \" , won't they just leave it blank rather than lie ? OK . You don't think they 'd just leave it blank if it says has a big \" Optional \" right next to it ? It It I think it 's better to put \" Optional \" . I mean , that 's why I put it there , s but it seems like maybe you disagree . Mm - hmm . Well I didn't mark anything else as specifically optional , So . Um , and then the next are two sections One indented separately . So , one 's for native English speakers and one for non - native English speakers . OK , so for the native English speaker it asks for a variety of English with three circle boxes American , British , Indian and Other , for write - in . Yep . Jane and I discussed this , and it was it was again the same problem that it 's gonna be a self - evaluation anyway , and so I don't want to have to be standing over the person and asking them \" Well , do you mean that your native an l an language was British when you were born , and then it changed to American when you were two , and then it changed to \" and so on . Right . I mean , th there 's room on the form to put al a a line of instruction , but I 'm just not sure what it re should really be . So the the for the non - na for the native English speakers we have Variety of English and Region . And that 's it . And then we have another form later down which is um , list other language influences . Right , neither would I . Um , I don't think we can do that because it would be different for If you 're American English it would be region of the US . That that so that 's why I didn't have circle forms . Because it would be different depending on what your language is . So It - I think it would be however you would identify your own . And , as I said I don't really see a way of doing a circle fill in , because there would be there would have to be one for American English , one for British English , one for you know , one for each type . But but that would mean I would have to do generate a different form for circles , if you 're American English or British English or Indian English . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I just don't know what to do about the other varieties of English . Well , that 's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down . Well , there could be a circle one . Right ? So , you could say \" What region did you grow up in from these years ? \" and have a set of circ of six or seven circles Yeah . What language was spoken in the home ? Depends of who you ask , what the age range is . Yeah , so this is why I So so th Well , the way it 's phrased right now , it 's clearly asking about language . And so , what it 's trying to get at is what you think you speak . Now , I think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak . But , other than having a trained linguist interview them and ask these very specific questions , I don't see a way around it . Because as you said , what you 're gonna have to stay say is \" Well , list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home and how good they were at it and how long they spoke it , and now list the ones in preschool and now list the ones in first grade and now list the ones your friends speak \" Right . So I want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking f uh forty - five minutes . So I think that adding the the TIMIT categories is a good idea , because that 's very easy for a person to fill out . But I think we still have this problem of is it gonna be a self - evaluation ? or are we gonna ask them \" what was it when you were four years old , or what was it when you were six years old , or what wher \" w What 's the best way of phrasing the question ? Or adapta or adaptation . Well maybe should we just Then maybe we shouldn't just shouldn't ask . Well , maybe for the native English speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it 's that unreliable . The other thing also is that I 'm asking for the variety of English , and I did just put American , British , Indian and other . So , I didn't put Canadian , Australian , and all the other varieties . e But do you think those three are OK ? OK . So that for the Eng - native English speakers , we 'll do variety of English , regions from the TIMIT labels , and another field . And then I thought this was be fast . Air conditioning . Right . Right , the way the way the form reads now , I think it 's pretty clear that 's what we 're asking cuz it says \" Native English speakers , Variety of English , American , British , Indian , Other , Region \" . And then we 'll have Southern English , you know , whatever whatever the TIMIT categories are . So I think i if you look at this fr Right . Right , so I it seems to me that if you read this form , i w it 's pretty obvious that it 's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak , not where you live . I mean , I don't say anything about where you live on the form . So it 's just in the section talking about language . Yeah . And then uh , as Jane said , the last question is \" List other language influences , bilingual dialects , et cetera . \" And that 's just and open - ended place for them to do . And then And then the bottom of the form is for not for them to fill out , but for us to fill out , for um the aliases and database speaker database that the person is in , since we 'll eventually anonymize and this will be a form a place for us to connect the two . And then the meetings that they attended , because there 'll be one form for each person . OK . So . Yeah , I guess I 'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff . Right . So , there 's another area which is non - native English speakers which asks for Native language , Region , and Variety of English . And that 's it . Proficiency . That 's a good idea . Well , do you think that 's That 's also because they know that it 's a re important for them to be good at it . So , don't don't you think they overrate rather than underrate ? So , but no , I think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of form . The the question are what are what would the categories be ? Yeah , I 'm I don't know . Being totally monolingual , I 'm not the right person to ask , to talk about this but it just seems to me that that doesn't the length of time doesn't really get at what we 're asking . Right ? It seems to be that asking about the proficiency , even if it 's self - rated , is what we wanna know . Mm - hmm . OK . With that form . Shall we wait for other forms later , or you Keep going more form Uh , the other form is a modified digits form . uh and it 's pretty sim this one 's pretty simple , it 's it 's very much what like the digits forms in front of us , except it doesn't ha ask for sex or native language . Um , so it 's Name , Email , Time , Date , Seat , Session , Mike number , Channel , Mike type . Uh , in case people have the same name . So I wanted Have the same name . Yeah , I 'm particularly sensitive to this cuz a good friend of mine in S in Seattle was named Scott Smith and there were fourteen of them in at Boeing . So We could drop email . I mean that 's not a big deal , it 's just uh Right . Well , the other way I was thinking about it was assigning them an ID but I hate it when people do that to me , when they say , here 's you ID , don't forget it . So , I I wanted just something that would give us a hint of who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it 's a duplicate . Your mother 's maiden name mother 's maiden name social security number , So , although the email email will change , I think that 's a good way of doing it . We 'll be able to backtrack from email . Um , and then the other thing I was thinking about and it probably wouldn't be on the digits form , but it it is something that some form about the individual meeting . Now , the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out . Just to pick up an arbitrary an example . Right . So th so the sorts of questions I had were one Who 's gonna fill it out , and who 's gonna take responsibility for filling it out in each meeting , I mean , will we re will we require it . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And that was my other question , which is um what sort of information do we want to record ? I mean , so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy . You know , source , destination , relation . Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record ? Right . I think that fits in well with the whole meeting map mapping meetings concept is that 's another way of looking at looking at it . So , are there anything other than pairwise ? Oh yeah , OK . Yes , shirt certainly . I 've been thi I it seems to be that there is We could attach more structure if we wanted to . Especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships . Um , just as an example , it would be , \" Source , Adam Janin \" , \" Destination , Morgan \" , \" Relationship , Advisor \" . that are relevant . Yep . Right , so my example was not a good one , because that 's Right . Well , it 's just cuz it 's my turn . Well , the D T Ds mean we can do whatever however we want it . But what I what I was thinking uh the reason that I didn't want to make it completely open - ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common . Especially with these pairwise ones , where you can describe them and pairwise . And you might want a tool that used that information . Sure , absolutely . Right . Right Well I think being being in a common organization was one I hadn't thought of , that So you 're football league was a good one . So the ones I 've been thinking of are all sort of uh , power , responsibility . I guess husband - wife is yet another one . Ach ! Hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Some more . OK . Nope . Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise , so that 's probably not sufficient . Yeah , maybe not . Yep . OK . Well , I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway . So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it . Right . Right . So it We can regenerate a lot of this information . But Even if we can't , generate it , I think it 's alright to have some of the sections in your database blank , that this information was not collected for this meeting . And there 's just not gonna be a way around that . That 's just gonna happen like the N S A meeting , the networks meeting . I don't think they 're gonna want to fill out that information . So . OK , enough on forms . They haven't received them yet , but I did get a response from them saying \" Yes we 're still alive , we haven't done anything yet . \" basically . And uh Yeah . So so , they 've transferred the responsibility to someone else . I can't remember his name McCoond ? Something like that , but uh And so he sent me email and said he 's gonna be starting to work on it , and I haven't received anything else . So . So tomorrow I 'll send a email and just ask if he received it , he should be getting it today . Actually he should have gotten it yesterday . But . Give him a day . Hmm . And And And did is this from the mixed signal ? OK , so there is some normalization already , in that they 've been volume equalized uh over the entire signal . Right . Right . Well , but the mixed signal already has a normalization in it . Well , I think it 'll be worse , right , I think the mixed Or window it hamming window . Huh . Right . And he has on his graph something like forty percent . It looked like fifty percent or more are point two seconds or longer overlap It 's li I think the last page . Nope , not the last page . Where was it ? It was one of the tables . Fifth page . Oh , it 's seventy - five percent ! Um And the length It seems like with the overlaps being fairly long , that should make it easier . That r that was an interesting statistic . That they 're much longer than I expected . Ninety percent of them are over two m two hundred milliseconds . It is good , but it 's uh but it surprised me . Yes . For example . Two hundred milliseconds , hamming window . Hmm . Did you typecast to long ? or size - T or whatever it is ? I don't remember what it is . One of the problems , if the file is large , um , and you 're cast to the wrong type . Right , if you 're sending at an integer instead of a long . Typecast from integer , \" int \" INT or long or unsigned long . I think it 's Yeah . Well , It 's one possibility . Yep . Mm - hmm . Yep . Shall we do digits ? Uh , digit form one eight seven one one eight nine O . five four six eight nine zero seven eight six seven six zero eight seven four zero eight nine O O six three O three six one four five four one two one three seven zero four eight seven O nine O five five six seven nine three O two six zero three one nine eight zero three two three four OK . Are we done ? Yes , OK . OK , we are going off ."
