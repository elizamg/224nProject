    "transcript": "We 're we 're live by the way , so we 've got a good intro here Yep . We can edit that out if you want . OK . So . This time the form discussion should be very short , right ? OK . Good point . Hi Jane ! We just started . Could you take that mike there ? Thanks . No , I just took over the entire s uh entire channel um sampled ten minutes randomly . Yep . Yeah , this was quite quick and dirty , and it was just for listening . And for listening it seems to work really well . So . But , it 's not Not a good measure . Yes , absolutely . Except that it 's hard to judge this because the they 're not normalized . It 's just number of frames . But yeah , even so . Interesting And I was just going to say that that right now we 're just exploring . What you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system . And so even if if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap . No prayer . That was a great overlap by the way . Well , but But I think that 's what I was saying about different types of overlap . Right . Mind if I turned that light off ? The flickering is annoying me . Tone Sure , but tone might be very Yeah , you 're \" mm - hmm \" tone is going to be very different . You could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of backchannels , if you could if you had a good model for it . Your \" mm - hmm \" detector . Right . Hmm . It would be interesting , though , to talk , maybe not at the meeting , but at some other time about what are the classes . Yeah , it would be interesting . Yep . Mm - hmm . Well , I mean we 're also talking about a couple of different things . I mean , one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you 're doing . And the And they could be quite different . Yep . Well we 're not any time soon going to get a forced alignment . So . Um If it 's not hand - marked then we 're not going to get the times . I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News . That might be good enough . Yeah . It 'd be worth a try . It would be interesting to see what we get . Yep . Yep , if IBM doesn't Yeah Right . Forms Next iteration of forms . Oops . Nope . One 's a digit form , one 's a speaker form . So one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits . So don't fill these out . This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like . So , they incorporate the changes that we talked about . On which one ? Oh you mean on the digit form ? Uh , because the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest . So it was intentional . It 's an interesting observation , but it was intentional . Because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and , excuse me , the time is when you actually read the digits , but I 'm filling out the date beforehand . If you look at the form in front of you ? that you 're going to fill out when you read the digits ? you 'll see I 've already filled in the date but not the time . Yeah , I 've noticed that in the forms . The the reason I put the time in , is so that the person who 's extracting the digits , meaning me , will know where to look in the meeting , to try to find the digits . I know . And I haven't said anything . Yep . No , it 's about fifty fifty . Actually it 's about one third each . About one third of them are blank , about one third of them are when the digits are read , and about one third of them are when the meeting starts . So . I could put instructions ? Nah . But if I 'm not at the meeting , I can't do that . Yep , but that is the reason Name , Email and Time are where they are . And then the others are later on . Mm - hmm . What ? What which form are you talking about ? Oh you 're talking about the digit form . The digit form doesn't The digit No , that 's alright . The digit form doesn't have a \" for official use only \" line . It just has a line , which is what you 're supposed to read . So on the digits form , everything above the line is a fill - in form and everything below the line is digits that the user reads . No , either way is fine I just You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to . Right . Yep . Just as uh as I have for all the others . That 's because the one , the digit form that has native language is the old form not the new form . Yeah this was the problem with these categories , I I picked those categories from TIMIT . I don't know what those are . With TIMIT , yeah ? So , I was gonna ask wh w I mean . So so what accent are we speaking ? Western ? Yeah , I mean you could call it whatever you want . For the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one . So I just left it blank and you can put whatever you want . Sure . So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety . You know , when I wrote I was writing those down , I was thinking , \" You know , these are great if you 're a linguist \" . But I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know how to categorize them . Yeah So I guess my only question was if if you were a South Midland speaking region , person ? Would you know it ? Is that what you would call yourself ? Yeah . Well , We I think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form . I think that 's alright if we want to follow up . But . Yeah , so I picked these regions cuz we had talked about TIMIT , and those are right from TIMIT . So . Yeah , I certainly don't . I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak . Am I speaking Am I speaking Western ? Northwest ? Yeah , so this is a real problem . I don't know what to do about it . I c I think at the first level , for example , we speak the same . our our dialects Or whatever you region are the same . But I don't know what it is . So . a techno - speak accent ? A a geek region ? No problem . There are hardly any subjects from \" beep \" Yeah really . Well well we sort of Well , I like the idea of asking \" what variety of English do you speak \" as opposed to where you 're from Because th if we start asking where we 're from , again you have to start saying , \" well , is that the language you speak or is that just where you 're from ? \" And I mean . So so I would say Germany You know am I speaking with German accent I don't think so . Oh , OK yeah . Yep . Yeah , I guess I could try to put squeeze in a little map . I mean there 's not a lot of r of room I think of those , Northern is the only one that I don't even know what they 're meaning . Ye - hhh . I don't think the Northwest people speak any differently than I do . @ @ That that 's exactly what we 're arguing about . We don't know . I mean some of them are very obvious . If you if you talk to someone speaking with Southern drawl , you know . Or Boston , yeah . But is Boston New England ? W I guess that 's the problem with these categories . OK , so . I propose , take out Northern add , don't know . So you want to change the instructions also not just say region ? I don't know if I if I read this form , I think they 're going to ask it they 're going to answer the same way if you say , \" What 's variety of English do you speak ? Region . \" as if you say \" what variety of region region do you speak ? Please characterize your accent ? \" They 're going to answer the same way . Oh , I see . Well what we talked about with that is is so that they would understand the granularity . I mean that 's what I had before , and you told me to list the regions to list them . So . I mean I had it wide open last week and and you said TIMIT . That 's what the \" Other \" is for . Won't they answer the same thing ? Right . I mean that 's why I put the \" Other \" in . Yep . So I mean , I I mean the way I had it last time was Region was blank , it just said Region colon . And and I think that that 's the best way to do it , because because of the problems we 're talking about but what we said last week , was no , put in a list , so I put in a list . So should we go back to Well , certainly dropping \" Northern \" I think is right , because none of us know what that is . Is \" Midwest \" one word ? And uh But that 's true of New England too . So . I mean only one Well , I shouldn't say that . I have no clue . I was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is New York City . But I have no idea whether it does or not . I think that that was what happened with TIMIT , was that it was an analyst . New England Oh , no . \" Other \" , it goes under \" Other \" , definitely under \" Other \" . OK . So . Another suggestion . Rather than have circle fill in forms , say \" Region , open paren , E G Southern comma Western comma close paren colon . \" Actually , maybe we do one non - English one as well . Southern , Cockney ? Is that a real accent ? How do you spell it ? N E Y ? OK , we 'll do it that way . Actually , I like that a lot . Because that get 's at both of the things we were trying to do , the granularity , and the person can just self - assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are . Yep . Mm - hmm . Yep , just which one . I think that 's fine . Yep . Um , did you guys get my email on the multitrans ? That OK . Yeah . So . So . I I have a version also which actually displays all the channels . But it 's hideously slow . The what the ones I applied , that you can actually do are Dan 's , because it doesn't slow it down . Just uses a lot of memory . No , the the one that 's installed is fine . It 's not slow at all . I wrote another version . Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view , It has multiple panes with the views . But the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls . It 's really bad . Mm - hmm . As you play , as you move , as you scroll . Just about anything , and it it was so slow it was not usable . So that 's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it . So . I think that the one Dan has is usable enough . It doesn't display the others . It displays just the mixed signal . But you can listen to any of them . No , he suggested that , but he didn't It 's not installed . No . No . Um , not if we 're going to use Tcl - TK At least not if we 're going to use Snack . I mean you would have to do something ourselves . Why don't we we see how Dan 's works and if it If we really need the display I mean . We we could do that but that would mean changing the code . I mean this isn't a program we wrote . This is a program that we got from someone else , and we 've done patches on . So . Yeah . Not easily . I mean y yes we could do that . You could you can write widgets in C . And try to do it that way but I just don't think it Let 's try it with Dan 's and if that isn't enough , we can do it otherwise . I think it is , cuz when I was playing with it , the mixed signal has it all in there . And so it 's really It 's not too bad to find places in the in the stream where things are happening . So I I don't think it 'll be bad . And if if Depends on how much work they did . I think if if if one of us sat down and coded it , so that it could be displayed fast enough I 'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it . But it 's not a trivial task . Yeah . anyway , shall we do digits ? OK . OK . Well , you want to go first ? Or . Do you wanna go do digits or do you wanna just skip digits ? Then Alright . You go ahead . Why don't you read the digits ? Yeah , don't Don't read the old one .
