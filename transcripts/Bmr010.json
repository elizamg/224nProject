    "transcript": "Well , I 'm I sent a couple of items . They 're they 're sort of practical . I don't know if you 're if if that 's too practical for what we 're focused on . OK . Well , um , I can give you an update on the transcription effort . Uh , maybe raise the issue of microphone , uh , um procedures with reference to the cleanliness of the recordings . And then maybe ask , th uh , these guys . The we have great great , uh , p steps forward in terms of the nonspeech - speech pre - segmenting of the signal . Well , it 's a it 's a big improvement . I beg your pardon ? I beg your pardon ? I think that would be a good thing to start with . Yeah . Do I I hear you you didn't Uh - huh . Yeah . Uh , they they think it 's a terrific improvement . And , um , it real it just makes a a world of difference . And , um , y you also did some something in addition which was , um , for those in which there was , uh , quiet speakers in the mix . And you also provided me with several different versions , which I compared . And so you change parameters . What do you wanna say something about the parameters that you change ? Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . That 's true . But it it saves so much time the the transcribers just enormous , enormous savings . Fantastic . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , which is , um OK , and and also Da - Dave Gelbart . So there 's this this problem of and w and so we had this meeting . Th - the also Adam , before the the before you went away . Uh we , um regarding the representation of overlaps , because at present , um , because of the limitations of th the interface we 're using , overlaps are , uh , not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , and as might be desired I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately . So we don't have start and end points at each point where there 's an overlap . We just have the the overlaps encoded in a simple bin . Well , OK . So @ @ the limits of the over of of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the the interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful . Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my my view and I think I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus , is that , um , a thorough - going musical score notation would be the best way to go . Because you can have multiple channels , there 's a single time - line , it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things . OK . So , um , um , I spoke I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on on and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation . But , um , he in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties . So , do you wanna say something about that ? Under Windows . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . We could uh , potentially so . I also wanted to be sure I mean , I 've I 've seen the this this is called Praat , PRAAT , which I guess means spee speech in Dutch or something . But In terms of it being Windows versus But I 'm just wondering , is ? Oh ! I see . Oh , I see . So Praat may not be It 's a different one . I see . Oh , I see . OK . OK . Alright . Mmm , yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And and I was just thinking that , um , if it were possible to bring that in , like , you know , this week , then when they 're encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know , the start points and end points of overlaps . uh Th - they 're making really quick progress . And , um , so my my goal was w m my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month . And it 'll be I 'm I 'm I 'm clear that we 'll be able to do that . I sent it to , um who did I send that to ? I sent it to a list and I thought I sent it to the e to the local list . You saw that ? So Brian did tell me that in fact what you said , that , uh that our that they are making progress and that he 's going that they 're going he 's gonna check the f the output of the first transcription and and Oh , that 's this is a new development . OK . Super . Super . OK . Great . Yeah . Isn't that great ? Yes . That 's true . Mm - hmm . Good . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah , exactly . And just keep those things separate . And and , um , Dan Ellis 's hack already allows them to be able to display different waveforms to clarify overlaps and things , so that 's already Oh , yes , but Well , uh , yes , but what I mean is that , uh , from the transcriber 's perspective , uh , those two functions are separate . And Dan Ellis 's hack handles the , um , choice the ability to choose different waveforms from moment to moment . Um That 's true . Yeah , but that 's that 's OK , cuz they 're they 're , you know , they 're focused on the ear anyway . And then and then the hack to preserve the overlaps better would be one which creates different output files for each channel , which then would also serve Liz 's request of having , you know , a single channel , separable , uh , cleanly , easily separable , uh , transcript tied to a single channel , uh , audio . Not directly . I 'm trying to think if if I could have gotten it over a list . I don't I don't think so . Oh ! This was from before December . Yeah . OK . OK . That 's right . OK . I 'm keeping the conventions absolutely as simple as possible . Yeah . Yeah . N there was also this , uh , email from Dan regarding the speech - non nonspeech segmentation thing . I don't know if , uh , uh , we wanna , uh and Dan Gel - and Dave Gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect of using amplitude as a a a as a basis for the separation . Cross - Uh - huh . OK . OK . Fantastic . Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic , um , channel identifier . That that , you know , that would g help in terms of encoding of overlaps . The the transcribers would have less , uh , disentangling to do if that were available . But . Mm - hmm . OK . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Um , to code d so types of overlap ? Um , so at a meeting that wasn't transcribed , we worked up a a typology . And , um Yes , exactly . That hasn't changed . So it i the it 's basically a two - tiered structure where the first one is whether the person who 's interrupted continues or not . And then below that there 're subcategories , uh , that have more to do with , you know , is it , uh , simply backchannel or is it , um , someone completing someone else 's thought , or is it someone in introducing a new thought . Mm - hmm . Well , one would That 'd be that 'd be nice . I mean , I I I I 've This is wonderful to have a direct contact like that . uh Well , th lemme ask you this . It occurs to me one of my transcribers t told me today that she 'll be finished with one meeting , um , by well , she said tomorrow but then she said you know , but the , you know let 's let 's just , uh , say maybe the day after just to be s on the safe side . I could send Brian the , um the transcript . I know these are er , uh , I could send him that if it would be possible , or a good idea or not , to try to do a s forced alignment on what we 're on the way we 're encoding overlaps now . Good . Yeah ! Super . Super . Yeah , yeah . Oh ! Yeah . I I I don't know for sure . That would be like that 'd be like him . He 's great . Yeah . That 'd be great . And there 's no adaptor for it ? Seems like there 'd be a OK . Mm - hmm . Oh . Wow . Is Uh - huh . That 's interesting . Well , what I wondered is whether it 's possible to have to maybe use the display at the beginning to be able to to judge how how correctly I mean , have someone do some routine whatever , and and then see if when they 're breathing it 's showing . I don't know if the if it 's Can you see the breathing ? Cuz I Oh . Yeah . Uh - huh . Good . Yeah , i That 's true . It just seems like i if something l simple like that can be tweaked and the quality goes , you know , uh , dramatically up , then it might be worth doing . But Mm - hmm . My my feedback from the transcribers is he is always close to crystal clear and and just fan fantastic to Well , I mean , you Yeah , of course . You 're you 're also uh , your volume is is greater . But but still , I mean , they they say I it makes their their job extremely easy . Yeah . Mm - hmm . I could say something about about the Well , I don't know what you wanna do . Yeah . About the transcribers or anything or ? I don't know . They are . They 're putting Eh , so in curly brackets they put \" inhale \" or \" breath \" . It they and then in curly brackets they say \" laughter \" . Now they 're they 're not being awfully precise , uh , m So they 're two types of laughter that are not being distinguished . One is when sometimes s someone will start laughing when they 're in the middle of a sentence . And and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh . So , um , I I did s I did some double checking to look through I mean , you 'd need to have extra hhh e extra complications , like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of of the laughing through the utterance . And that and what they 're doing is in both cases just saying \" curly brackets laughing \" a after the unit . Good . Oh ! OK . OK . Then And let me ask y and I gotta ask you one thing about that . So , um , if they laugh between two words , you you 'd get it in between the two words . But if they laugh across three or four words you you get it after those four words . Does that matter ? Yeah . OK . I think he 's right . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Good . You you did get me to thinking about I I 'm not really sure which is more frequent , whether f f laughing I think it may be an individual thing . Some people are more prone to laughing when they 're speaking . But I can't Yeah . OK . Yeah . OK . Um , um , the I I 'm really very for I 'm extremely fortunate with the people who , uh , applied and who are transcribing for us . They are , um , um , uh really perceptive and very , um and I 'm not just saying that cuz they might be hearing this . No , they 're super . They 're the they very quick . Yeah , I know . I am I 'm serious . They 're just super . So I , um , e you know , I I brought them in and , um , trained them in pairs because I think people can raise questions you know , i i the they think about different things and they think of different and um , I trained them to , uh , f on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed . This also gives me a sense of You know , I can I can use that later , with reference to inter - coder reliability kind of issues . But the main thing was to get them used to the conventions and , you know , the idea of the th th the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back so these th sort of calibration issues . And then , um , I just set them loose and they 're they all have e a already background in using computers . They 're , um they 're trained in linguistics . They got Well , they they 're very perce they 'll So one of them said \" well , you know , he really said \" n \" , not really \" and \" , so what what should I do with that ? \" And I said , \" well for our purposes , I do have a convention . If it 's an a noncanonical p \" That one , I think we you know , with Eric 's work , I sort of figure we we can just treat that as a variant . But I told them if if there 's an obvious speech error , uh , like I said in one thing , and I gave my my example , like I said , \" microfon \" in instead of \" microphone \" . Didn't bother I knew it when I said it . I remember s thinking \" oh , that 's not correctly pronounced \" . But it but I thought it 's not worth fixing cuz often when you 're speaking everybody knows what what you mean . But I have a convention that if it 's obviously a noncanonical pronunciation a speech error with you know , wi within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native English American English speaker , you know that I didn't mean to say \" microfon . \" Then you 'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word , and that just signals that , um , this is not standard , and then in curly brackets \" pron error \" . And , um , and other than that , it 's w word level . But , you know , the fact that they noticed , you know , the \" nnn \" . \" He said \" nnn \" , not \" and \" . What shall I do with that ? \" I mean , they 're very perceptive . And and s several of them are trained in IPA . C they really could do phonetic transcription if if we wanted them to . But I think And I 'm also thinking these people are a terrific pool . I mean , if , uh so I I told them that , um , we don't know if this will continue past the end of the month and I also m I think they know that the data p source is limited and I may not be able to keep them employed till the end of the month even , although I hope to . And Oh , that 'd be so super . They would be so s so terrific . Mm - hmm , that 's right . And with the right in interface Mm - hmm . That 'd be great . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Oh , wonderful . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Wonderful . And then school will start in in the sixt on the sixteenth . Some of them will have to cut back their hours at that point . But Some of them are . Yeah . Well , why do I wouldn't say forty - hour weeks . No . But what I mean is Oh , I shouldn't say it that way because that does sound like forty - hour weeks . No . I th I I would say they 're probably they don't have o they don't have other things that are taking away their time . But it 's you can't . No . You 're right . It 's i it would be too taxing . But , um , they 're putting in a lot of And and I checked them over . I I I haven't checked them all , but just spot - checking . They 're fantastic . Yeah . Yeah . Well , you know , and I also thought , y Liz has this , eh , you know , and I do also , this this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved . These people would be great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted , or whatever . So , um . Mm - hmm . OK . Yeah . Th - that 'd be I think that 's a a good idea . You know , there 's also , the e In my mind , I think A An - Andreas was leading to this topic , the idea that , um , we haven't yet seen the the type of transcript that we get from IBM , and it may just be , you know , pristine . But on the other hand , given the lesser interface Cuz this is , you know we 've got a good interface , we 've got great headphones , m um Something like that . That 's that 's true . Al - although you have to s Don't you have to start with a close enough approximation of the of the verbal part to be able to ? OK . OK . Mm - hmm . OK . Oh , excellent . OK . OK . Excellent . I guess there 's another aspect , too , and I don't know uh , this this is very possibly a different , uh , topic . But , uh , just let me say with reference to this idea of , um , higher - order organization within meetings . So like in a you know , the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other , uh , uses of the data , so being able to find where so - and - so talked about such - and - such , then , um , um e I mean , I I I did sort of a a rough pass on encoding , like , episode - like level things on the , uh , transcribed meeting already transcribed meeting . And I don't know if , um where that i if that 's something that we wanna do with each meeting , sort of like a , um it 's like a manifest , when you get a box full of stuff , or or if that 's , um I mean , i I I don't know what uh , level of detail would be most useful . I don't know i if that 's something that I should do when I look over it , or if we want someone else to do , or whatever . But this issue of the contents of the meeting in an outline form . OK . OK . That 's fine . I 'm finished . Oh , yeah . Oh , yes . Mm - hmm . Oh , k Sorry . Scale . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . He has this on his board actually . Don't you have , like those those several different categories on the board ? @ @ Oh . Mm - hmm .
