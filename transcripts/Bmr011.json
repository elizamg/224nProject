    "transcript": "Are we on ? We 're on . OK . Yeah . OK , so , uh , we haven't sent around the agenda . So , i uh , any agenda items anybody has , wants to talk about , what 's going on ? It 's on ? OK , agenda item one , introduce Don . OK , we did that . Uh OK , so let 's let 's So let 's just do agenda building right now . OK , so let 's talk about that a bit . Uh , @ @ tuss close talking mikes , better quality . OK , uh , we can talk about that . You were gonna starting to say something ? No , no , that 's OK . We can so we can ta so n NIST is NIST folks are coming by next week and so we can talk about that . I think Uh , uh , John Fiscus and , uh , I think George Doddington will be around as well . Uh , OK , so we can talk about that . Uh , I guess just hear about how things are going with , uh , uh , the transcriptions . That 's right . That would sorta be an obvious thing to discuss . Um , An - anything else , uh , strike anybody ? OK . Um , Yeah , so , uh OK . Alright , that seems like a a good collection of things . And we 'll undoubtedly think of other things . Oh , under the NIST meeting . OK . Alright , why don't we start off with this , u u I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . Um , so , better quality close talking mikes . So the one issue was that the the , uh , lapel mike , uh , isn't as good as you would like . And so , uh , it it 'd be better if we had close talking mikes for everybody . Right ? Is that is that basically the point ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right , so one th uh , well one thing I was gonna say was that , um , i we could get more , uh , of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of radio channels we have because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order . And the main thing is having the microphone close to you , u although , not too close . Yeah . Is . Yes . Right . How am I d Yeah . Well , I mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of if this microphone seems OK to people , uh , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . Yeah . Yeah . No , but my point is R r right Right now , we 've got , uh , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard . So why don't we replace those Well , however many we can plug in . You know , if we can plug in three , let 's plug in three . Also what we 've talked before about getting another , uh , radio , and so then that would be , you know , three more . So , uh so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do , but have them all be the same mike . I think the original reason that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or , uh , more uniformity , but @ @ but uh , sounds sounds fine . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . When we 're doing Yeah . Now , this is locking the barn door after the horse was stolen . We do have thirty hours , of of speech , which is done this way . But but , uh , yeah , for future ones we can get it a bit more uniform . Yeah , probably yeah , to the store we talked about and that OK . OK . OK . Yeah . Uh , OK , second item was the , uh , NIST visit , and what 's going on there . Um , something I guess I didn't put in the list but , uh , on that , uh , same day later on in or maybe it 's No , actually it 's this week , uh , Dave Gelbart and I will be , uh , visiting with John Canny who i you know , is a CS professor , who 's interested in ar in array microphones . Yeah . And so we wanna see what commonality there is here . You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things or or maybe it 's it 's not a specific array microphone they want but they might wanna just , uh , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these these table mikes and trying to do something with them Um , I also had a discussion So , w uh , we 'll be over over there talking with him , um , after class on Friday . Um , we 'll let you know what what goes with that . Also had a completely unrelated thing . I had a , uh , discussion today with , uh , Birger Kollmeier who 's a , uh , a German , uh , scientist who 's got a fair sized group doing a range of things . It 's sort of auditory related , largely for hearing aids and so on . But but , uh , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , uh , head models and microphone things . And so , uh , he 's he and possibly a student , there w there 's , uh , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , uh , may come here , uh , in the fall for , uh , sort of a five month , uh , sabbatical . So he might be around . Get him to give some talks and so on . But anyway , he might be interested in this stuff . Right . A little bit , I mean , he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of e e given that , the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side , if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there . And if if someone 's talking on on on , uh , one side or the other , it goes the other way . And then , uh , it it it even looks different if th t if the two two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle . It it actually looks somewhat different , so . Mm - hmm . Right . Yeah , well you have to the appropriate normalizations are tricky , and and and are probably the key . Yeah . We 've switched positions recently so you can't Anyway . OK . So those are just a little couple of news items . Yes . Right . Probably not but I I 'll I 'll I 'll know better after I see him this Friday what what kind of level he wants to get involved . Uh , he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , uh , or he might have no interest whatsoever . I I just really don't know . Well that 's what they 're starting up . Yeah . No , I mean , that 's what all this is about . They they haven't done it yet . They wanted to do it Uh , well I think they 've instrumented a room but I don't think they they haven't started recordings yet . They don't have the t the transcription standards . They don't have the Yeah . I think . I think they are . Well , I 'm I 'm I 'm not sure . All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings . And , uh , it is related to ours . They were interested in ours . They wanted to get some uniformity with us , uh , about the transcriptions and so on . And one one notable difference u u actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not , but one one , uh , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes . So , um , I mean , I 'll just tell you the party line on that . The reason I didn't go for that here was because , uh , the focus , uh , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was uh , in impromptu situations . And we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it . And so , uh , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it . But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , uh , one or more other people i uh , in in an p impromptu way , where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be . And therefore it would not it 'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with with some very carefully designed array of microphones . Um , so it was only for that reason . It was just , you know , yet another piece of research and it seemed like we had enough troubles just No . So there 's there 's uh , there 's a whole range of things there 's a whole array of things , that people do on this . So , um , the , uh the big arrays , uh , places , uh , like uh , Rutgers , and Brown , and other other places , uh , they have , uh , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something . And so there 's a wall of mikes . And you get really , really good beam - forming with that sort of thing . And it 's and , um , in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff , but it d it d we ended up not doing it . But Yeah , it 's r It 's really neat stuff . And then they had the little ones , yeah . Yeah , our block of wood is unique . But the But the No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something and and , uh , um So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do . Um , so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's that 's a good thing to do . I mean , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask . Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask \" um , are you recording video ? \" Um , right ? And and the acoustic people will always say , \" well are you doing , uh , uh , array microphones ? \" So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have . So maybe maybe we 'll do some more of it . Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the But if you get somebody who 's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction . Well , uh , at some level at some level . But then , you know , there 's it there 's There 's I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . And , th Yeah . Yeah . But I mean , uh , for optimum flexibility later you 'd want to save each channel . But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional . Right ? So See the problem is it it took , uh , uh , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes . And it was a really big deal . And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily and , uh , have it mixed to to one channel of some sort . But , e I think for @ @ I mean , how we 're gonna decide For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that . I mean , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can And to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up , we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes . And there we 're already using fourteen . E Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So I think you 'd need a separate a separate set up and the assumption that you could time align the two . I 'm not so much worried about disk space actually . I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , but the real issue is that , uh , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew . So you would have a t completely separate set up , which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this . So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , one that would go up to thirty - two channels or something . So basically or a hun Yeah . So , I 'm kinda skeptical , but um I think that So , uh , I don't think we can share the resource in that way . But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours which might be useful for for them . And then we can offer up the room , Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on . Yeah . Well I thi yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do . Uh , we 'll see . Right , so we have we Yeah , so it 's , uh , people people getting shy about it . There 's this human subjects problem . There 's the fact that then um , if i I I 've heard comments about this before , \" why don't you just put on a video camera ? \" But you know , it 's sort of like saying , \" uh , well we 're primarily interested in in some dialogue things , uh , but , uh , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . \" I mean , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in . And , uh , you really want to do it right . So I think NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that . We there will be other meeting recordings . We won't be the only place doing meeting recordings . We are doing what we 're doing . And , uh , hopefully it 'll be useful . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we we We we we we don't , uh we don't we don't perform electro - shock during these meetings , and Yeah . OK . Uh , transcriptions . So if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go Are you ? But they 're not giving f really fine time markings . Um , it 's historical . I mean , uh , some point ago we thought that uh , it \" boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that \" , you know , like we just did , and , um , here 's , uh , a a , uh , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it . So , that was a contribution they could make . Uh in terms of time , money , you know ? And it still might be a good thing but Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , so . We 'll see . I mean , I think , th you know , they they they 've proceeded along a bit . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , uh , you know , have some more discussions with them . Mm - hmm . Yeah . I I think that they are , um , yeah , I 'm sure they will and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it . I mean , it sounds like Liz has some concerns and That 's great . I guess the other thing , I I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , uh , I know you and I talked about this a little bit , there was an issue of , uh , suppose we get in the , uh , I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , uh , where we we , uh uh , we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were we 're the we 're still a bit slow on feeding at that point we 've caught up and the the the , uh , the weak link is is recording meetings . OK , um , two questions come , is you know what how how do we uh , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? And the other one is , um , uh , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? So , um , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was Right , so I think we talking about three level three things . One one was uh , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings , types of overlaps , and so forth that that someone could do . Second was , uh , somewhat lower level just doing these more precise timings . And the third one is is , uh , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have which is that , um , if , uh if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . For instance , uh , marking in some overlapping potentially overlapping fashion , uh , the value of , uh , ar articulatory features . You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here , there 's it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth . Um , as opposed to doing phonetic uh , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis , and , uh , assuming , uh , articulatory feature values for those those things . Um , obviously that 's extremely time - consuming . Uh but , uh , we could do it on some small subset . Mm - hmm . Well , yeah , but I think also it 's just the issue that that when you look at the u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone at that point because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here and and and it 's so I Yeah , describe describe it . Now I 'm suggesting articulatory features . Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things , um , and uh , I mean , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to Sort of . I mean , it 's still some sort of categories but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just \" click , you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound \" and so on . Yeah , something like that . I mean , actually if we get into that it might be good to , uh , uh , haul John Ohala into this and ask his his views on it I think . No , I think I think it 's for for for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally . And then you have i and then and then it 's natural in all senses , in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that you know , one might have , and you have the close mikes , and you have people talking naturally . And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally , right ? So so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus , if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus um , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , uh , uh , censored choices , we don't have the video , we don't and so forth , but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . And , uh , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . Yeah . Yeah and hopefully someone would make use of it . I mean , people didn't uh , I mean , people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT and , uh w due to its markings , and then the Switchboard transcription thing , well I think has been very useful for a lot of people . So Yeah . Yeah . Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings , right ? Mm - hmm . Yes . Great . Yeah . He - he 's supposed he 's supposed to be trained to do it . Mm - hmm . I think they 're open to it . I think , you know , all these things are I think there 's we should go beyond , uh , ICSI but , I mean , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could . So it 's just Yeah . So the No , no . No . So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group but even there he hadn't What he 'd said \" no \" to was for the main meeting . But they have several smaller meetings a week , and , uh , the notion was raised before that that could happen . And it just , you know it just didn't come together but Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , so I mean there 's possibilities there . I think Jerry 's group , yes . Uh , there 's there 's , uh , the networks group , uh , I don't Do they still meeting regularly or ? But I mean , ha ha have they said they don't want to anymore or ? Uh , i i Yeah . OK , so they 're down to three or four people but the thing is three or four people is OK . OK . Yeah , with with with potential use from the defense department . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , th there 's a problem there in terms of , uh , the um commercial value of of st uh , it it it it turned out to be a bit of a problem . Mm - hmm . Of all all nat all native speakers . Why ? Well , I don't I don't I don't think if he didn't say that I bet he did . I remember wh I I remember a study I remember a study that BBN did where they trained on this was in Wall Street Journal days or something , they trained on American English and then they tested on , uh , different native speakers from different areas . And , uh , uh , the worst match was people whose native tongue was Mandarin Chinese . The second worst was British English . So h it 's , you know , t the the the German was much better , it was Swiss w Yeah , so it 's so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want , uh American English , yeah . It it yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of I think so , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . It 's pretty tough , uh , this group . Yeah . So , uh , what about what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor ? I mean , film - making or something like that . You 'd think like they would be Yeah , I know you are . Yeah . Put a little ad up saying , \" come here and argue \" . They could have a discussion about te about about tax cuts or something . Yeah , now that is not actually what we Yeah , but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing . Yeah . Anyway . I had as my fourth thing here processing of wave forms . What did we mean by that ? Remember @ @ ? Oh , you already did that . Yeah , and Dave uh Gel - Gelbart again , he 's he 's interested in in fact we 're look starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things . Which uh Hmm ? Well , let 's w i isn't that what what you want t No , so No , i w wha what you what you want when you 're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better . Right ? And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by , uh by any room acoustics or is it just uh , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ? Uh OK , so it 's OK .
