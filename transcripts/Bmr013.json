    "transcript": "New version of the presegmentation . Per digit . @ @ Place . Yeah . Uh , oh yeah , um , I worked a little bit on the on the presegmentation to to get another version which does channel - specific , uh , speech - nonspeech detection . And , what I did is I used some normalized features which , uh , look in into the which is normalized energy , uh , energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the , minimum over the , other . within each channel . And to to , mm , to , yeah , to normalize also loudness and and modified loudness and things and that those special features actually are in my feature vector . And , and , therefore to be able to , uh , somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in in the different in each channel . And , eh , I tested it on on three or four meetings and it seems to work , well yeah , fairly well , I I would say . There are some problems with the lapel mike . Yeah . Uh , yeah . And . Yeah . And . Yeah , and and I had I had , uh , specific problems with . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah yeah , then I I did some some some things like that , as there there are some some problems in , when , in the channel , there they the the speaker doesn't doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all . Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , uh , there the system doesn't work at all . So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something , so , that 's that 's great for for my purpose . And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references . Yeah , that 's the one one wh where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on So the thing is , can the transcribers perhaps do some , some some meetings in in terms of speech - nonspeech in in the specific channels ? Yeah . Oh , great . OK . OK , that 's great . That 's great for me . Yeah , so . OK . Yeah . Yeah . OK . OK . Yeah . Yeah . so , yeah yeah , that that that 's great , but what would be nice to have some more meetings , not just one meeting to to be sure that that , there is a system , OK . Yeah . It seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , so . But I 'm not sure about how much . Both both . Different different number of speakers , different speakers , different conditions . Yeah , m Yeah . Uh , not really as uh , because of the normalization , yeah . Yeah . OK . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . With the recognizer ? Yeah . Yeah . M I I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for for the system , as I 'm not sure if if it 's really good to compare with with some other automatic , found boundaries . Yeah . Yeah sure . Yeah . Yeah . To a adjust them , or , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , great . Yeah . OK , great . If it 's not the first minute of of the meeting , that that 's OK with me , but , in in the first minute , uh , Often there are some some strange things going on which which aren't really , well , for , which which aren't re re really good . So . What what I 'd quite like , perhaps , is , to have , some five minutes of of of different meetings , so . Yeah . I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah . That 's but but I hope that I I don't need to do it . So , uh it c can be do in an unsupervised way . So . I 'm I 'm not sure , but , for for for those three meetings whi which I which I did , it seems to be , quite well , but , there are some some as I said some problems with the lapel mike , but , perhaps we can do something with with cross - correlations to , to get rid of the of those . And . Yeah . That 's that 's what I that 's my future work . Well well what I want to do is to to look into cross - correlations for for removing those , false overlaps . I 'm I 'm not sure , um , if if there are any wired mikes in those meetings , or , uh , I have have to loo have a look at them but , I 'm I 'm I think there 's no difference between , Yeah . Yeah . No . Yeah , that Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . That 's that 's . So . Do the transcribers actually start wi with , uh , transcribing new meetings , or are they ? OK . OK . OK . Yeah . OK . Yeah . Yep . Yeah . Sure . I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , uh , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yep .
