    "transcript": "When the power went out the other day and I restarted it , it crashed the first time . After the power out Well this wasn't Actually , this wasn't a before your meeting , this was , um , Tuesday afternoon when , um , uh , Robert just wanted to do a little recording , and the power had gone out earlier in the day . Talk about a good noise shield . You know ? You wanted to pe keep people from listening in , you could like have that playing outside the room . Nobody could listen in . And then we 'll we 'll go back later and review the individual channels , right ? If you wanna know what Practically , huh . With all the overlaps . I wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was . Yes , um , he 's I I 'm sorry , I should have forwarded that along . Uh , oh I I think I mentioned at the last meeting , he said that , um , he talked to them and it was fine with the beeps they would be That 's easy for them to do . Well for this experiment I think we can use pre pretty much anything . This experiment of just Well we 've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe . But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to f I I don't think it matte Right , so we need to run Thilo 's thing on it , and then we go in and adjust the boundaries . Right . OK . And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try . I don't know , maybe we can figure out how long it 'll take @ @ to to do . I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , um , how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries , and I mean , is it pretty easy ? As of what point ? I mean . The I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to IBM , or do we go ahead and send them a sample ? Let their Well I I I mean , I don't know . Yeah . Uh . That I agree . I agree . We 're just doing the individual channels , right ? So it 's gonna be , depending on the number of people in the meeting , um , I don't see how that will work , though . Yeah . Yeah . I That 's that 's what I 'm I 'm concerned about the part . Can't we uh couldn't we just have , um , I don't know , maybe this just doesn't fit with the software , but I guess if I didn't know anything about Transcriber and I was gonna make something to let them adjust boundaries , I would just show them one channel at a time , with the marks , and let them adju But i but it 's very quick , right ? I mean , you scan I mean , if you have a display of the waveform . Uh - huh . The problem is if if anything 's cut off , you can't expand it from the chopped up Did you run the Andreas the r SRI recognizer on the digits ? I it wasn't Zero percent error ? This is error you 're talking about ? OK . And it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the Yeah . Yeah , so I was curious about that . I didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight - forward . I thought he 's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it . Right . So you just have to look over longer time when you 're trying to align the things , you can't you can't just look Well , Andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ? Mmm . Because really the the at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea , uh , for each channel about the start and end boundaries . We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries , so Yeah . Yeah . Right , exactly . So that 's why I was wondering if it I mean , maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff , we can just not use that and We c you know what ? Maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these . Cuz you can see the seat numbers , and then you can see what type of mike they were using . And so we just look for , you know , somebody sitting next to Adam at one of the meetings What what is why do you need the , um , the forced alignment for the HLT I mean for the Eurospeech paper ? So it was to get it was to get more data and better to to squeeze the boundaries in . Ah , OK . Yeah . Thilo 's won't put down two separate marks in that case Yeah , we were never just gonna go with these as the final alignments . We were always gonna run them past somebody . Could you could you at the same time adapt the reject model to the speech from all the other channels ? Oh , not just the speech from that of the other people from that channel , but the speech from the a actual other channels . If you Actually if if you have a larger head , that mike 's gotta go farther away which means the the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down . Can I see that ? I yeah , I don't want it on , I just I just want to , um , say what I think is a problem with this . If you are wearing this over your ears and you 've got it all the way out here , then the balance is gonna want to pull it this way . Where as if somebody with a smaller head has it back here , right ? Yeah . Then it then it falls back this way so it 's So this is supposed to be under that little protuberance . Yeah . So it 's really supposed to go more like this than like this . But then isn't that going to Well , I guess you can control that . It would be an advantage . The other thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound weight off the back . Hang a five pound weight off the back . Counter - balance . Did did they give a talk on this or was this informal ? What was the , um the paper by , um , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ? What was their rough what was their conclusion ? Did they ever try going going the other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks , or ? Mm - hmm . Do you remember who the groups were that we 're doing ? Was were there folks from BBN presenting ? Was SRA one of the groups talking about summarization , no ? This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora . That the differences we 're seeing in the front - end is b are irrelevant once you get a real recognizer at the back - end . You know ? But doesn't their conclusion just sort of you could have guessed that before they even started ? Because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better , then as you approach there 's a point where you can't get any better , right ? You get everything right . So they 're all approaching . But what I 'm saying is that th they have to , as they all get better , they have to get closer together . But they 're all going the same way , right ? So you have to get closer . Oh they didn't ? Maybe they should have said \" focus \" or something .
