    "transcript": "We 're on . So , I think we pre - crashed , so I think we 're OK . So it should be a really short meeting , I hope . Uh , agenda items , number one , I wanna talk since we were just discussing that is microphone issues . What the heck are we gonna do about microphones ? So uh I got passed on that the EDU group doesn't like the uh , Crown mikes . I do . I l I think I find them very comfortable . Uh , but it seems to depend on your head shape . That 's right . Yep . Um , Right . So apparently they they like It has one good effect , that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike . People who show up late have to use these . So , um , we should probably get different mikes . So the question is , the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more , um , Sony mikes . Just two more of those , um . And that that 's easy and that will certainly work . The other option is to try yet another mike . Find one we like and potentially get six , all the same . Um , these are better , if they 're worn correctly . Yeah . Yeah , definitely . Yeah . Yeah . So , I mean , they 're not a lot better , but they are a little better . Um , they 're more directional , a little better error uh , noise cancellation , and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth , like this , whereas that one , to avoid breath noise , you really have to put it at to the side . So you seem to get better signal with this one . I don't know , but you know , in in sort of random polling I mean , so s Well , I mean , that 's the other option , is that we could switch the form so it 's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike , um , and then get duplicates . I mean , there 's no problem with that . It 's just what Should we get just more Sony ones ? I hate the Sony ones . b the one you 're wearing . Because it it pinches pinches the temples too much . I mean , so , if you wear it sort of around the back , it 's not too bad . But I Right . Right . So , I mean , we could try another mike . But then we have the wiring issue , and So I I don't know what to do . What do what do people think ? The plug is proprietary . So that 's why I was saying getting more Sony ones is trivial , because we can just go out and buy them . Any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired . Yes . So , the only possibilities from Sony are that one and the lapel mike . So this isn't Sony . This is Crown . The one we 're wearing . And so we had these wired for us . And so I think that 's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately , and have them available . Right . And just make sure that you write down \" Crown \" or \" Sony \" on the mike number , which I 'll change to mike type , or something like that . Yep . Well , it 'll be me It 'll be whoever 's setting up the meeting , who fills out the key file , so It has the same potential for error as everything else . No , no , we definitely would not have the user fill it out . It would be me , Chuck , or Liz , depending on which meeting it is . OK , so we 'll de definitely go ahead and do that . Couple hundred . Yeah . It depends on how good the mike is . Well the Crown ones were like two - fifty . I think those are like one - ninety . But . Yeah right . No . Yeah , good mikes are expensive . So . Mm - hmm . Yeah , eighty or ninety for the Shures . So . I mean , the Sony ones are expensive because they 're proprietary , so they can charge whatever they want . These are expensive because they 're quite high quality . So . So we should buzz that out if we send the data to Sony . Well , I 'm just joking . So , you do not have to bleep that out . I don't mind if Sony knows my opinion . So . Um . Also , we 're pro I wanna double check with Morgan , he did say yes before I went to Japan on buying another wireless system so that we can go all wireless , instead of the mix of wired and wireless . And I think that 's the right thing to do . And I 'm Yep . Yep . Four more wireless . Um . And also I 'm gonna re probably replace the Andrea mike with a Shure , but I 'll test it , uh , sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the Shure one really works , cuz I have an extra Shure in my office . Yeah , apparently it 's had some problems . Yeah . It 's uh This one . In the meantime , right , because uh it 'll it 'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from Sony anyway . So Oh really ? Yeah . I guess cuz everyone 's been out of town . Probably over the summer it 'll be the same cuz it tends to be less , fewer people . Um , File Uh , done with microphone issues , I think ? If you want . And this way we can get a door - slam in the uh in the transcript file . Oh well . No - not quite a slam . Uh , the door - slam phone ? And then we could have the phone phone , for for when the phone rings . Um , Uh , file reorganization . This is something we were talking about before I left and saying we should probably wait until after I 'm back , and now I 'm back , so , we should do that at some point . So we should get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else . Sure . Mm - hmm . Shorten . Is that the same as shorten ? Well , OK , you mean it 's built into the SRI , because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools . So . So it 's just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools . Oh really ? I didn't know that . Well , that 's not a sound tool , right . Right . Mm - hmm . Shortening everything on the fly . You had another process running that was shortening it . Yep . Did you have to re - nice one of the processes to make sure that \" shorten \" ? Watching the disk meter . The list , yep . Start end . Yep , the way Feacalc calc does it . It would be easy . It wouldn't be hard at all . Someone just needs to d sit down and do it who has some time . And that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around . About the only difficulty with that is if it 's compressed . Then you really do have to decompress it first . Right ? Because the pointers are Y you don't know how much it 's comp It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount . And yeah I mean , that it Well , I mean , it just depends on how much disk space is a problem . I mean the what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it . But . That 's true . Yeah . Well , it seems like just shortening them is a good short - term solution so we don't have to do any coding . So . No , it was I was still here . It was the day I left . No if I if I had done it on purpose I would have timed it right after I left . Mm - hmm . Well , I think there was something else going on , because uh Dave Johnson said that DD was getting accessed frequently . And it shouldn't be . Right ? That data never gets touched , because we write it once and then we never touch it again . The wave files . I mean , he was saying gigabytes . And so , it has to be the wave files . Yeah , so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet , but we should definitely double check on it . Every night . So at any rate , so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we 're gonna do and then when we 're gonna do it . So I 'm not sure who isn't involved with that . I mean , certainly me , Chuck and Jane . Anyone else care ? Right . So , maybe we should do that not during this meeting but s another time , and just get a list of everything we 're gonna do . OK . So just update all the naming conventions and put all the files where they really belong , on one disk , and then leave leave everything in place until the back - up until the next full back - up and then delete the old ones . So . Well , both need to be reorganized . So um , various paths , th I mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way , because um Yes , exactly . That too . So that 's what I was saying . We need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do . And so I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out , so I assume that 's alright with everyone . Oh . And OK . Then I should have made that as an agenda item . Right . Well , I mean , how you choose to do it the naming is up to you . So . Yep . Right . I Actually I was gonna do a global search - replace on all entries at at ICSI to change MR to MRM at all places at ICSI . Y you Well , maybe I shouldn't say that on re record . There was a typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone , one of our sponsors , did a global sear search and replace for between \" sponsor \" and their name . And so , it it was saying , uh Well , anyway , I won't I 'm not sure whether that 's right . Yeah , one can imagine the problems that that would engender . So . Right . Um , Thilo , you had you wanted to talk about the So you should probably talk to a Sys Admin and get it put in some central place . So that it 'll work on all the NT machines . Right . So I assume Tcl - TK wasn't already on the machine , so you had to install it . Yeah . Hmm . Mm - hmm . So , w what features did you use ? So not RASTA , just PLP . Huh . Who cares ? No , just would be a sign change . How many iterations ? Mm - hmm . OK . Hmm . So this is just combination at the utterance level . Why do you think the ICSI front - end is so much worse ? That seems really odd to me . Oh right . Right , right , right . Ca - can you run the SRI Just as an experiment , run the SRI front - end without vocal tract norma normalization , and see how much difference it makes ? If we could figure out how . Yeah , but the They won't they don't correspond one - to - one though . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Right . Hmm . Right . It gets pretty big . And m my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better . So . For for whatever that 's worth . Oh yeah . Yeah . So w Yep . It was mostly MSG , PLP , RASTA . So , you know , the feature sets we had available . And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level . You know , so we 'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities . Yep . You 'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards so that they 're uh orthogonal . So you 'd wanna do a linear transform also . Yep . Vocal tract thing , yeah . I was thinking about tandem system Well , let 's not talk about it here , but I had some thoughts about the tandem system . OK , should we do digits ? Do we have any other topics ? OK , let 's do them one at a time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time . Transcript L one O five . nine four two three two seven seven zero nine nine nine seven O nine three eight zero O O one two nine O eight five five eight seven seven five three nine five five seven three four four seven nine six two seven four two seven three eight O eight six five seven zero nine one zero three five two three zero nine five three nine two five O two nine three three one two Why don't we let Don go first before his battery dies ? You can really tell from the prosody where it goes . After digits , I don't know . Go ahead . Mm - hmm . Probably . We could probably build that in to the front - end . I don't know , uh eh . Fff . What would you like it to do when that happens ? Well if an unblacked out channel is zero , is actually spitting out zeros , you can be pretty sure it 's off . Because it doesn't spit out zeros , it spits out epsilons . Right ? Cuz there 's little background noise . The question is , when the software detects it , what do you want it to do ? I mean , it it it We we already have visual feedback , right ? You can see whether your mike is working or not . Um . Yep . Turn off the screen saver during the meeting . Yeah , I d I don't know what to do other than There 's no sound out right now . Yep . Yep . Yeah yeah . That would be good . Well , we can think about what to do about it , but it It 's pretty clear we can detect it , so . OK . Are we done ?"
