    "transcript": "Mm - hmm . Hmm . Hmm . Hmm . Yeah , that 's true . I 've noticed that . Yeah . Which makes sense . Oh , on the email . Yeah . Well , and then the other possibility was e that we provide them with a a file that already has the beeps in it or something . Wasn't that what you said ? Uh - huh . Yeah . Oh ! Hmm . Oh ! M - one - hundred . Oh . Well But Well you th So just r r truly chron chromatically up all the way through the entire meeting . Interesting . It 'd be impossible to r to misorder them . Yeah . It 's pretty simple , pretty simple . Hmm , interesting . Well . Well , \" high \" , \" low \" is pretty straightforward , yeah . You 'd have to they 'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t hear into the high high ranges . Yeah . Mm - hmm . It 's a shame we can't really give a number . So it would be a number and a beep . e It 's a shame we can't do that . That 'll work . Wow , that 'd also be shorter to type . Interesting . Oh , that 's true . Or maybe could it be a click and the number . Or a beep and the number , and then and then you just do the the num th you do it as a d a digit . Well , if if it saves time , yeah . It might actually help them in terms of their place holding . Yeah . And it might be helpful to them in terms of d act Know Well , no no no no . OK . I i And then also , if we I mean , I don't know what their setup is , but your template idea might be a way of of of We could actually build the numbers into a template . Well . That 's a good idea . Very simple . It 's forty - five minutes . Forty - five minutes for that one . It 's possible . Yeah . That 's right . Yeah , it was forty - five minutes . Hmm , interesting . Well , with just one digit though , I think Well , and the other thing is , maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah . I think it would save them time . I think it would help them keep the track track of it . Interesting , yeah . So , someone 's gonna talk to Brian . OK . I also looked thr over the text and I was impressed by the accuracy , it looks really good . Yeah , it 's there . Mm - hmm . Oh . Yes . But this is not important . It 's systematic , yeah . And and Brian actually forwarded me in advance . He he wor he very nicely worked out a set of conventions which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they 're used to . Which is which is really a good a good way to do it . No problem . Yeah . We can do it this week . Yeah . I thought we were going to get two more of the ones Can I I c I I actually really like them though . Yeah , I do . The other thing , too , is th y you said that the acoustic pra q quality of the one that you 're wearing , the fancy one , is actually somewhat better than So I I don't know if it 's a noticeable difference , but it is I mean , I p I personally really prefer that model , so I think you know we 've got this problem of people having different different preferences . OK . Mm - hmm . It 's I I understand , that 's fine with me . I I g would say that um , I find this model easier to adjust , that 's one of the reasons I don't like these , cuz I keep m you know , bending it , and then it 's n and I never really know You do ? OK . Hmm . @ @ Huh . Then they have to be rewired though , don't they ? Specially . Yeah . Mm - hmm . You you put it over the corner of your ear . I can't I 'm having competing microphone headphone problems here . This one . It 's an interesting idea . The acoustics the acoustics on this are really s m better than when I talk into it directly . Works with this . I don't know . I had another thought . Would w would it be possi There are scripts that uh , run , and and when it 's finished compressing , would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict ? Have them But after the meeting 's done , would they want to ? That 's true . Yeah , that 's true . Also it seems like once it 's been stored that night , it 's it 's possible to recover from backups , so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded . Yeah . Yeah . And I 'd prefer it to go through me . Well I p At this point Yeah . Yeah . w w Well - I I wanna also say that , you know , this is a uh , uh , My my view on this is that once it 's in a final version and I 'm working toward all these being final versions , then it can go into this next ro this next realm . But it it 's sort of counter - productive to have changes made which I would be making if I 'd just gotten that far in the file . You know , it 's it 's , um . Yeah . That 's right . And then after that , then this would probably work . Yeah . Good , good . Well , the \" key \" file is ke \" key \" file 's different . \" Key \" fi Well , \" key \" file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel so - and - so , it 's useful as a repository for putting that there . And also if you notice that there was an extra speaker , and didn't get mentioned in the \" key \" file , but they were only there for a second , but it 's t useful to mention that they were there . So I th I think that the \" key \" file is usefu for notations related to the meeting , but it 's different from the transcript . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Hmm . Hmm . That 's interesting . Oh . Oh . Mm - hmm . Well , I also think , um , that the type of change ch ch varies an I think it 's a very good point . Because what if the uh , what if one set of changes one person was making was with reference to some typographical convention . And the other person n unkn n quite unknowingly , was changing it the other way around . Then you could end up with a real mess , in terms of , like , consistency of conventions across a file , there is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level . But I like b I like what Liz is saying about That 's right . And I also like I l also like Liz 's uh , k um , phraseology of \" at this level of \" I don't remember how you put it , but this \" at this level of transcription \" or whatever . I mean it 's like there are different layers of whatever and different types of conventions , and if it were an acronym , then I would I think that it would make sense f for them to have input into that level of things , but I wouldn't want them to be changing Yeah . Mm - hmm . Well , yeah . I agree . Well Well , I see now , we 're k back into the same situation as when we were , uh , talking about a allowing people to edit the transcripts before they become public . So there 's a question of how easy or how hard to modify , and how that impacts the amount of changing that 's done . And I I think that it 's , um , I I have received some suggestions for change , which I 've made . And um , I think with an acronym , that 's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate . But it would worry me to have people , um , having free reign to change these things , because of the need to have consistent conventions . And people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . I agr I agree but I have to also add one other thing which i before I forget it , which is Adam 's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts . u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting . You said that there were some places where it wasn't what y was written already , but you could see how they might have thought that 's what it said . So there it 's not just a right and wrong thing . Sometimes there tru there are absolutely stretches where there is no no k if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person , maybe , m you know , they could they could 've told you , but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you , even if they were listening to it . So , sometimes it isn't right and wrong , sometimes it 's multiple interpretations , and Now But of course , this does raise the possibility of allowing , um , an extra annotation for , you know , alternative interpretations of a stretch . But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong . Or overlooked or not overlooked . Sometimes they 're truly ambiguous , and um , uh , um , nice to have a notation for that , but . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And als it also Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
