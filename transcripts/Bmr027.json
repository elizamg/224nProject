    "transcript": "OK . It 's the ear - plug mike . No . Huh ? What ? Huh ? It it 's a fairly good mike , actually . Well , I shouldn't say it 's a good mike . All I really know is that the signal level is OK . I don't know if it 's a the quality . Ugh ! So I didn't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two . So . And , uh . Right . Well We haven't really started , but I thought we more we more or less did Meeting Recorder stuff last week , so I thought we could do , uh But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . So . I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . Here we go . So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies and , uh , so far no one has made any Ach ! any comments on them . So , no on no one has bleeped out anything . So . I don't expect anyone to . But . No . We had spoken w about this before and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once . And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . So as long as we do that , we 're covered . Uh , July fifteenth . Yep . Jane told me July fifteenth . So , that 's what I set it . Oh . I I didn't understand that there was something specific . You y you had I had heard July fifteenth , so that 's what I put . So . Yeah . As I said , we I just got one date and that 's the one I used . So . But I can send a follow - up . I mean , it 's almost all us . I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these the meetings that in are in set one . Right . I mean , that 's fine . I we don't My understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply . We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want . And so no reply is no changes . Right . Well Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly , as opposed to , uh Right . When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me . So . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Well , the only thing I said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . I didn't give any other deadline . So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , \" wow I suddenly found something \" , we 'll delete it from our record . We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released . What else can we do ? If someone says \" hey , look , I found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and I want it removed \" . What can we do ? We have to remove it . Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ? No . OK , well why don't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ? I already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email . And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ? Mm - hmm . Right . OK . I don't know . You should be . You should be channel B . Well , they 've already signed a form . So . And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects , so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify . Here . You can read what you already signed . Right . Oh , I just I didn't wanna do that , because I don't wanna have a discussion with every person if I can avoid it . So what I wanted to do was just send it out and say \" on the fifteenth , the data is released , if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it \" . Well , OK . l Let me Let me reverse this . So let 's say someone I send this out , and someone doesn't respond . Do we delete every meeting that they were in ? I don't think so . That will happen . That will absolutely happen . Because people don't read their email , or they 'll read and say \" I don't care about that , I 'm not gonna delete anything \" and they don just won't reply to it . No . We have what they put on the speaker form , which was just generic contact information . Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . So . Well OK . Well , why don't you talk t Morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , and find out what the status is on this ? Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to . Because what I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email . No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with . And do we want to spend that effort ? Well , we had talked about this before and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form that they 've already signed once . Yeah . OK . OK . Well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , Morgan was you were saying let 's not do anything , and now we 're we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? I mean , what are we gonna doing here ? Mm - hmm . Then I think we had better find out , so that we can find a Right . For for th Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . Sending lots of spam . Yep . Well , so how far do we have to go ? Do we need to get someone 's signature ? Or , is email enough ? Do we have to have it notarized ? I mean OK . Mm - hmm . Uh . If they submit the form , I get it . If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . But that 's not sufficient . Right ? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't imply anything in particular . Right . I 'm already on it . Mm - hmm . W For this set , I 'm not worried , because we basically know everyone on it . You know , they 're all more or less here or it 's it 's Eric and Dan and so on . But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work , and So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ? Mm - hmm . Other methods ? OK . Well , the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be . I mean , because they they filled out a contact information and that 's where I 'm sending the information . And so far everyone has done email . There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . Yeah . So my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that we fulfilled our burden . OK . Alright . Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email . So far , two people have . So . Right . Respond to the email . Yep . Right . Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . Right . Ugh ! Disk space , oh my god ! I hadn't thought about that . That for every meeting any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . No , of course not . You need all the channels . Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk . Well , but you have to copy the whole file . Right ? Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file . Yeah . It 's just I hate deleting any data . So I I don't want I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out and then Overlapping . So , it 's it 's exactly a censor bleep . So what I really think is \" bleep \" and then I want to I delete the old one , put the new one in . There 's nothing left of the original signal . Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again . Say again ? Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true . Backwards . But , ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . Did you read that paper ? It wouldn't work . The speech recognizer still works . Forward but backward . That 's right . Good point . A point . Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing . It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . So . Yeah . Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it . Because , you know , I have my stack of emails of to d to be done , that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to . And , uh So so Yeah , right . So , i this is gonna mean Yeah . Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point . The m email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form and Yeah , release . You you can A lot of mailers support return receipt . But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it . Right . Oh , just a button . Oh , yeah . Yeah . Unfor - Yeah , we could do that . But I hate that . Yeah . Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty and even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . So . Yeah . Reply . Well , I cuz I use a text mail reader . You you read email in VI ? You could put wed bugs in the email . Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . So . Tha - that was my intention . It 's just yeah that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . I mean , maybe Is that the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ? Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff . So at some point we need to do that . I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . There are a fair number of \" yeahs \" and \" uh - huhs \" that it 's just that aren't in there . So . Yes , absolutely . Yeah . Yes , absolutely . Absolutely . Yeah . They 're they 're not in the segmented . It 's not that the IBM people didn't do it . Just they didn't get marked . There 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? Right ? Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . U uncertains . Web master . Yep . Spit upon ? No , these are ours . That 's cool . Yeah , but I bet I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . Oh , really ? Uh , it 's Oh , so it 's just jargon . It probably won't do any better . Did I say that ? Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in , is that I was afraid people would say , \" let 's censor that because it 's wrong \" , and I don't want them to do that . Yeah . Ugh ! It 's probably impedance matching problems . But Mm - hmm . They 're just earphones . They 're not headsets . They 're not microphones . But if you need it , just get it . Come on . W uh , could you email out the brand ? Cuz I think sounds like people are interested . So . Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . Oh , I thought you meant the disk space . Yeah , we know disk space is short . Yeah , it was really goo Uh , well , we 'll give you one then . Oh , no . Soon ? No . Ne - new disks . On Yeah . Once they come in . Sure . If you 're if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive . But I I vacillate between no space free and a few gig free . So . OK . Yeah . A hundred gig here , a hundred gig there . It 's eventually real disk space . Oh , yeah . Huh . Or she 's getting a good early start . When we remember to fill them out . Yep . And Don is gonna be helping out with that . So . Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon ? Not here , but later today ? OK . OK . Oh , OK . So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription automatic transcription , but we 're kind of running late . So . Fifteen minutes . So . If you wanna do a quick ten minute Yeah . Well , we can skip the digits . Whatever you want . What do you have to say ? I 'm interested , so Sorry . No . We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting . And this week we were gonna try to do t automatic transcription status . But we sort of failed . No . Did we ? OK . OK . So now now we have the schedule . So next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , plus anything that 's real timely . Whew ! Dodged that bullet . Th - Excuse me ? Yeah . Oh . Right , right . Mm - hmm . Right . When 's it due ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . I don't have a paper but I 'd kinda like to go , if I could . Is that alright ? OK . I guess that 's \" no \" . OK . Well , that th Hey , if that 's what it takes , that 's fine with me . I 'll pick up your dry - cleaning , too . Should we do digits ? Uh .
