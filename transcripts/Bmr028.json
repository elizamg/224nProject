    "transcript": "And we 're going . So the only status ite well , first of all we h haven't decided whether we 're Meeting Recorder data issues , or recognition this week . I think we were recognition . You only sent me one thing , which was demo status . And asking which one we were on this week . So should we simply assert that this week we are recognition , and next week data issues , and ? And , uh So , I think what we should probably do is any quick , small stuff we can do every week . So like Morgan asked about the demo status . We can go ahead and talk about that a little bit . And then do then alternate in more depth . OK . Actually , I may not be here either . So I gotta double check the dates . But , anyway . So , uh , demo status . First of all , I did a little thing for Liz with the Transcriber tool , that , um first of all , it uses the forced alignments , so that the words appear , uh , in their own segments , rather than in long in long chunks . She said that that she thought that was a much better idea for the other stuff she 's working on . Um And that works fine except it 's even slower to load . It 's already pretty slow to load . Yeah . Yep . And the Transcriber tool is just not very good n at at that . Correct . Yeah , it 's just writing conversion tools from the format that the aligner Actually th he did a SRT file for it . And then just back into Transcriber Transcriber format . Yeah . So my my decision was , for the first pass for this demo that Liz was talking about I decided that I would do , um , only enough to get it working , as opposed to any coding . And so the other thing I sh she wanted to display the stylized F zeroes , I think they 're called ? Is that right ? And , uh So what I did is I just took the file with those in it , converted it so that it looks like an audio file . And , so you s it shows that instead of the wavefile . And so that that 's working , and I think it actually looks pretty good . Um , I 'd like someone who 's more familiar with it to look at it because when I was looking at it , we seemed to have lots of stuff going on when no one 's saying anything . Ah . No . I the audio file you can specify any sampling rate . And so I s I specified instead of , you know , sixteen thousand or eight thousand , I specified a hundred . Um , and , the only problem with that is that there 's a bug in Transcriber , that if the sample rate is too low , when it tries to compute the shape file , it fails . Um , and crashes . Um But the solution to that is just , set the option so it doesn't compute the shape file , and it will work and the only problem with that is you can't , uh , zoom out on it . You can zoom in , but not out . The shape file is If you think about a wavefile , sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen . So what Transcriber does , is it computes a another thing to display based on the waveform . And it displays it at And it allows you to show m many different resolutions . So there 's a little user interface component that lets you sh select the resolution . And if you don't compute the wavefile , you can't zoom out . You can't get a larger view of it . But you can zoom in . Um And that 's alright , because at at a hundred samples that 's already pretty far out . And , uh so I think it looks pretty good , but I 'll let Liz look at it and see what she thinks . OK . We should If you were having problems with the words , we should figure out why . OK . You c you clip that part over your ear . Anyway . We 'll all watch Liz play with the mike . Um Uh , no . It doesn't have to , but that that 's I find that 's the only way to wear it . Is that the bud 's in the ear and that the link is over it . But , so , anyway , I think that looks pretty good . The only the only other thing we might wanna do with that is be able to display more than one waveform . And that actually shouldn't be too slow , uh , because it 's much lower resolution than a full waveform . The problem with it is just it does require coding . And so it would be much better to get , uh , Dave Gelbart to do that than me , because he 's familiar with the code , and is more likely to be able to get it to work quickly . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . I understand what you mean . Right . Ps - But for the demo maybe it doesn't matter . I 'm not sure whether you wanna do the demo live anyway , or just screen shots of what we have . The problem with doing it live is it takes so long to load , that , um Um , w I was talking to Dave Gelbart about that and apparently it 's not actually the parsing of the XML raw that going from the XML to an internal t tree structure is pretty fast . But then it walks the tree to assemble its dat internal data structures and that 's slow . Uh , no . But what it does is it actually assembles all the user interface components then . And then displays all the user interface components . Yes . A new transcript . Or audio file . Well , actually the audio files are pretty fast , too . Right . The only problem with that is if anything goes wrong or if you wanna switch from one thing to another . That 's true . We could just subset it . That 's a good idea . That 's actually probably the right thing to do . You know , just take f ten minutes instead of an hour and a half . Yeah . Yeah . So that that 's actually the definitely the way to do it . That 's a good idea . Yeah , if there are any problems . Yeah , I mean , even five minutes is probably enough . That 's what I did . Yeah . Yeah . I mean , just ask Just come by my office . I can show you as well . Right . And for the information retrieval , uh , Don has been working on that . So . It looks like it Great . Yeah . So I think for the L stuff Liz was talking about , we have something that 'll work now . And Liz can look at it and see if she wants anything else . Maybe we can work on doing displaying multiple or displaying one and playing back the other . Um , I think I 'd h I 'd have to ask Dave . I did it once before and it was just so slow to scroll , that I gave up . But , the advantage is that these things are much lower sampling rate . And so then it might be alright . Tcl . I mean , we could check . I don't think they do . Um , there was actually a Java back - end that apparently is actually a little faster . It generates byte code . But , uh Yeah . Well , e everything is faster than Tcl - TK . It 's a string substitution language , basically . I should probably beep that out in case John Osterhaut ever listens . But Well , it is wonderful . It is , for prototyping and user interface . It 's just really the language is awful . Beep , y right . But let me tell you how I really feel . Yep . Oh , that 's right . Then the other issue related to that is data release . If we wanna show this in public , it should be releas So , I , uh , haven't gotten any other replies from the original email asking for approval . So I sent out another set this morning . And , uh , we 'll see if we get any responses . Very good . Did you notice I put in the filter ? Go ahead . There 's a link there that now says if you want to search by filter by a regular expression , you can . I put that in just for you . It 's actually an arbitrary arbitrary regular expression . But if you search your name , you 'll get all of the things you said and any time anyone said your name . So . Correct . It 's hard to find . Hmm . Yep . You really do have to sort of r Yeah . That 's right . And it demonstrates why it doesn't work , because you really wanna go acro more than one meeting . And you need a better user interface for displaying the results . So . Yeah . Yeah , really . That 's right . Th - we do have that bi nice marker is that , n n because we all know we 're being recorded , whenever anyone says anything like that , we then have a conversation about bleeping it out . So . Yep . Um . Oh . And also we actually have a few people who have still not filled out speaker forms . Specifically in the NSA ones , and I noticed that when I tried to , uh uh , generate the transcripts for NSA . That there are a few with no speaker forms . And so , uh , I have a I sent out yet another this morning , which I think makes six total emails that I 've sent to these people , and so I think we need to escalate to some other method of trying to contact them . Nope . Well , if I could find phone numbers , that would certainly work . But . Yeah , that 's a good idea . I 'll ask her if she can con track some of them down . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I didn't actually see who they all were . Um , a couple of them were , like , people at IBM who were here for one of the IBM meetings and one a guy from SRI who was at one of the SRI meetings . And so , uh , those might be harder to track down . Yep . I mean , they they were people who didn't have accounts at ICSI , so they 're they 're harder to find . Am I sure about what ? There were other people also . There were other c other people also who didn't ha fill out the speaker forms , in addition to the N S As . Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Right . Yeah . None of the e emails bounced , so I know they 're going somewhere . That 's all I have . You wanna talk about recognition ? J T Liz , you wanna talk about recognition ? Thilo , you wanna talk about recognition ? Backchannel . It combines them if it 's if the pause is longer than Right . So the the trade - off is you get longer utterances , but you miss fewer utterances . Well , take a look Yeah . It 's , uh , funny looking at some of the transcripts . I was filtering by person , and in one of the one of the early meetings , one pers particular person , almost the only thing they said the entire meeting was \" yeah \" , \" uh - huh \" . It was just a whole list of them . It was very funny . Uh , do we know about disk ? Uh , Abbott disk ? OK . Yep . Couldn't format them . No . The only reason I 'm asking is , you 're gonna need space to split them up . And so I wanted to make sure we had some available for you . OK . So we 're OK we 're still OK for another couple days , then ? So we 're OK for for a couple weeks , then . Y yeah . He just didn't say when . So Ah . Yeah . I 'm sure he 'd appreciate that . Well , m my feeling about that is p is p Well , OK . That 's the point . So it 's Jane that we have to coordinate that through . Uh , what I was gonna say is , as soon as possible , and I 'm willing to not work for an hour to get it done . Uh , but Because when Abbott 's Yeah , right . Because when Abbott is down you can't work . But , uh , I think the per the people it disrupts the most are the transcribers . OK . So early next week . And just as long as we have a little warning . Uh , just not during that time when it 's down . But that it should be down for an hour . Right . Well , no , we can store them here . We can store them here . You we just run the risk that if you have a crash we lose the data . So . Yep . Yep . Anything else ? Excuse me ? Yep . We have a kernel on Popcorn , too . Mmm . Input reader and an output stream . Yeah . Yeah . That 's the point . Yeah . So , if if you Right . Quicknet is a very nice stream - based library , so without too much effort , once he has the classes written we can incorporate it into all the standard tools . So . And at some point , I 'd like to get back to , uh , porting Quicknet to the multiprocessor Linux box . You know , I I have forward passes working , but I haven't done training yet . Mm - hmm . Yeah . That 's right . Well , that 's the nice thing about it , is that i since it 's coarse parallelism you don't have to do anything special . So . I mean that would be a fine use for b for that machine . Five more processors . Yep . Oh , yeah . That 's really hard . It 's not determined . I think the first pass is throw out words which are overlapped . That would be a good first pass . Just ignore everything that has any overlap . Right . Yep . Yeah , eighty percent . Yeah . Well , but for a But , for s for scoring , you can do it or not do it as you choose . So . N well , but you can use the when you 're doing the scoring Since you 're you 're gonna be scoring against transcript , you can use Well , you 're doing that anyway . So ch chea try to cheat in the same way that you 're doing with the close - talking . Yeah , right . Yeah . Just do or a free ri Yeah . Yeah . They 're all gender - dependent . So we would have to at least do that . And pick whichever 's better . S does the clustering ? Do you give it sort of a target number of clusters ? Or is it ? adapted in some way ? Mm - hmm . That 's what I 'm just thinking one of the big differences with Broadcast News and these meetings is we have m many fewer participants . Speaker ID . Yeah . Well , there 're different ways of thinking about it . I mean that that would be true if w you had a meeting situation with multiple mikes . But if you only had your PDA sitting in front of you And you have more than one mike . Oh , so just from clustering . You might be able to cluster it better because of that . From mike . Yeah . And transfer functions . Well , I think there 're lots of lots of ways of doing it . Yeah . That 's an interesting It 's a big difference . Yeah . Well , humans are really good at that transfer function through the head , and things like that . So you know , even if you only have one ear , you can still get get good transfers . So Yeah . Yeah . Something . Yeah . Yeah . So it 'd be cool to see if it helped . That would be ft quick , since I think he did it in Matlab . Yep . Can't you export C from Matlab , or is that Mathematica ? Well , so just take the inverse and you 're fine . So that 's a speech detector . That 's great . Yeah . Just subtract that subtract that from the original signal and you 're set . Noise estimate . Signal to noise . That 's great . No . I guess that 's why Herve always talks about using the priors as one of the mixtures in in his all - ways combos . But still So if you run er , your recognizer with all probabilities equal , what do you get out ? Probably garbage . I bet the pruning The pruning probably prunes everything out . Yeah . That 's right . Different . But they are channelized ones , though ? Right . Cuz you haven't done any training . Right . Cuz we 're not doing it for training . Right . So it 's really it would be really easy to re - do it . Yeah . It 'd be interesting just to see i how much it changes . I bet it wouldn't change a lot . We can take we can have a pool . That 's just what I was thinking . Yep . I we know about it . Tran - Transcriber will export STM . In case you care . OK . Right . Right . But but If the segments change , that won't work . Well , I mean , what happens if you break one segment into two ? Suddenly the don they don't match at all and you can't line them up anymore . Right . Does STM do it per word , or por per utterance ? Th - what I thought . Alright . And then it does also some Within the segment . Yep . I see . One percent . All al All we mean by that is that we 're giving the recognizer more information than it would have if you were running it raw , over a meeting that no person has ever listened to or transcribed . It is . Yep . It 's us it 's using information you wouldn't normally have . So . Hmm . We 're not de - legitimizing the data . We 're de - legitimizing the experiment . We 're not saying that the data is cheating data . We 're saying th we are cheating by using this data . Because normally you wouldn't have that data available . Shoot . Just the clip . It 's p it it really is part of the jargon . Well That 's what I was saying . Uh , and it 's used for a lot of different types of data . So , segment whether you have segmentation or not , is it male or female or not Um , do you know the signal - to - noise ? Like , that 's another one I see all the time , where you assume it 's known . And you say it 's cheating because you don't actually compute it . N Right . Same cheating . Mm - hmm . It 's not even really negative . Fine - tune little bits . Hmm . Did you read the paper ? What what this w Right . What would this be like if w it were perfect ? If this component were perfect ? Hmm . It 's too hard , usually . It 's not pejorative at all . But , it 's not pejorative towards the data . It 's pejorative towards It 's pejorative to o ourselves . Right ? To say \" I am cheating in this experiment \" is not saying that the data is bad . It 's saying that my experiment is bad . Yep . Oh , right . I haven't gotten back to that recently . But I assume you 're saying you want me to get back to it . Hmm . Well Well , you can , but you 'll lose a lot of data . But , I mean , that doesn't really help because often the recording person isn't in the room . So , what are you gonna do ? I mean it will w the person if you 're looking up at the board and I disable the screensaver , you will see that the mike is off , but that doesn't necessarily help . So Mm - hmm . It 's just hard to tell between that and just someone not talking . So . Right . Mm - hmm . Well , we should be getting new equipment in , so we don't have to use the earplug any more . It 's your hair . I mean , y d you you can do sort of a check , but it will be very hard to tell the difference between that and , um , someone not talking . No . Little bit of noise . I use a threshold . If it 's below a particular value , it it flashes yellow . So as I eh but it 's not perfect . Yeah , probably . I mean , this is the reason why I haven't gotten back to it , is cuz my first pass at it didn't really work because all the mikes have different noise levels . And so I have to do something a little more clever . Yep . Yep . Yep . Yep . Yeah . There 's eh the s the standard deviation of the signal gives you a good clue . I mean , if that is too low , then you can be pretty sure that it 's , uh , empty . Right . Exactly . Uh - huh . Is there a ? Far - field . Yeah . Well , we 'll just We 'll we 'll just have to note those . Well , I I I think we can't throw away that data , cuz otherwise we 'll end up with very few meetings . But Do we have a ? I 'm sorry for interrupting . Do we have an EDU meeting at four ? OK . Great . Good . Cuz otherwise I was gonna say we have to cancel . A simultaneous digit . OK . Everyone ready ? S reading simultaneous digits ? Three ! Two ! One !
