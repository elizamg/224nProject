OK I 've got transcript one two seven one one two nine zero . one seven one O two eight one two zero seven one three four five zero nine six zero eight zero seven three eight six eight one three nine three four zero three nine four O four two zero one two zero three eight two three two four two eight one six five three five eight three O eight six five nine one zero seven six seven six six two eight seven nine O O five seven eight O four one four one I 've got to move a bunch of furniture . Let me see . Yeah , that 's good . You 're alright ? Will that be enough time ? I guess once you get past the bridge that that would be the worst . Yeah . Once you get past the turnoff to the Bay Bridge . Yeah . Yeah . OK . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Oh , I Did you happen to find out anything about the OGI multilingual database ? Oh , they are ? OK . And so , ideally , what you 'd wanna do is you 'd wanna run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages . And that way you can say , \" Well , \" you know , \" we 're gonna build it for what we think are the most common ones \" , but if that somebody uses it with a different language , you know , \" here 's what 's you 're l here 's what 's likely to happen . \" Right . I don't know anything about Finnish . Hmm . Hmm . Resistance is futile . So , when you said that you were getting the labels for TIMIT , um , are y what do you mean by that ? Mmm . Were the digits , um , hand - labeled for phones ? Or were they those labels automatically derived ? Mmm . I was just wondering because that test you 're t I I think you 're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not , uh , having s general speech performs as well as having specific speech . Mm - hmm . And I was yeah , so I was just wondering if the fact that TIMIT you 're using the hand - labeled stuff from TIMIT might be confuse the results that you get . Right , but if it 's better , it may be better because it was hand - labeled . Yeah . OK . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Right . What about the differences in the phone sets ? No , between TIMIT and the the digits . Oh , OK . I see . Out of that fifty - six ? Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . Mmm . Yeah , and I think some of them , they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning , when really they 're both silence . I th I think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty - six . Yeah . There 's not much difference , really . And the ones that are gone , I think are I think there was they also in TIMIT had like a glottal stop , which was basically a short period of silence , and so . I don't know . So . What about mel cepstrum ? Or is that you don't include that because it 's part of the base or something ? It 'd be an interesting test just to have just to do MFCC with the neural net and everything else the same . Compare that with just M - MFCC without the the net . Oh . Where did th where did that come from ? Digits ? Oh . Is that Was that distributed with Aurora , or ? Where did that ? What about TI - digits ? Uh - huh . Oh . Oh OK . Ah . I see . What about combinations of things ? Well , you just select multiple things on the one dimension . When you do that , you 're increasing the size of the inputs to the net . Do you have to reduce the hidden layer , or something ? No , no , I 'm I 'm just wondering about number of parameters in the net . Do you have to worry about keeping that the same , or ? But wh what about a net that 's trained on multiple languages , though ? Is that just separate nets for each language then combined , or is that actually one net trained on ? In one net . Mm - hmm . I don't know . Depends on the corpuses , right ? Is it faster to do it on the SPERT , or ? Is it ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So you 're just having a problem converting the labels . Nuh - uh . Right . Yeah , I 'm not sure what 's available on is it you said Nutmeg and what was the other one ? Mustard . OK . Right , right . Well , I 'll check on that . What you can do , when you 're on that machine , is , uh , just go to the slash - scratch directory , and do a DF minus K , and it 'll tell you if there 's space available . Uh , and if there is then , uh Well , there 's different there , um , there 's Right . So there 's the slash - X - whatever disks , and then there 's slash - scratch . And both of those two kinds are not backed up . And if it 's called \" slash - scratch \" , it means it 's probably an internal disk to the machine . Um . And so that 's the kind of thing where , like if um , OK , if you don't have an NT , but you have a a a Unix workstation , and they attach an external disk , it 'll be called \" slash - X - something \" uh , if it 's not backed up and it 'll be \" slash - D - something \" if it is backed up . And if it 's inside the machine on the desk , it 's called \" slash - scratch \" . But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away . It 's easy to unhook the external disks , put them back on the new machine , but then your slash - scratch is gone . So , you don't wanna put anything in slash - scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time . But if it 's a copy of , say , some data that 's on a server , you can put it on slash - scratch because , um , first of all it 's not backed up , and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine because you just recopy it to slash - scratch . So tha that 's why I was saying you could check slash - scratch on those on on , um , Mustard and and Nutmeg to see if if there 's space that you could use there . You could also use slash - X - whatever disks on Mustard and Nutmeg . Um . Yeah , and we do have I mean , yeah , so so you yeah , it 's better to have things local if you 're gonna run over them lots of times so you don't have to go to the network . Mm - hmm . Yeah , so , one of the things that I need to I 've started looking at Uh , is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff ? I 've started looking at , um , disk space . Dan David , um , put a new , um , drive onto Abbott , that 's an X disk , which means it 's not backed up . So , um , I 've been going through and copying data that is , you know , some kind of corpus stuff usually , that that we 've got on a CD - ROM or something , onto that new disk to free up space on other disks . And , um , so far , um , I 've copied a couple of Carmen 's , um , databases over there . We haven't deleted them off of the slash - DC disk that they 're on right now in Abbott , um , uh , but we I would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto , um , this new disk also . There 's there 's a lot more space there , and it 'll free up more space for doing the experiments and things . So , anything that that you don't need backed up , we can put on this new disk . Um , but if it 's experiments and you 're creating files and things that you 're gonna need , you probably wanna have those on a disk that 's backed up , just in case something goes wrong . So . Um So far I 've I 've copied a couple of things , but I haven't deleted anything off of the old disk to make room yet . Um , and I haven't looked at the any of the Aurora stuff , except for the Spanish . So I I guess I 'll need to get together with you and see what data we can move onto the new disk . I think that would be a I think that 's a big big deal . Because the you know , the thing that Sunil was talking about , uh , with the labels , uh , labeling the database when it got to the noisy stuff ? The That that really throws things off . You know , having the noise all of a sudden , your your , um , speech detector , I mean the the , um What was it ? What was happening with his thing ? He was running through these models very quickly . He was getting lots of , uh , uh insertions , is what it was , in his recognitions . What about training up a , um , a multilingual net ? Mm - hmm . Another year . So you 'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset . It uses special diacritics and stuff , which you can't do with ASCII characters . So the SAMPA 's just mapping those . So they just throw the speech from all different languages together , then cluster it into sixty or fifty or whatever clusters ? Automatically derived Mm - hmm . Automatically derived broad classes , or ? Uh - huh . So you 're saying that there may not be enough information coming out of the net to help you discriminate the words ? Hmm . So the targets of the net are these ? Articulatory features . But that implies that you can have more than one on at a time ? Ah . OK . I see . We could do an interesting cheating experiment with that too . We could I don't know , if you had uh the phone labels , you could replace them by their articulatory features and then feed in a vector with those uh , things turned on based on what they 're supposed to be for each phone to see if it if you get a big win . Do you know what I 'm saying ? So , um , I mean , if your net is gonna be outputting , uh , a vector of basically of well , it 's gonna have probabilities , but let 's say that they were ones and zeros , then y and you know for each , um , I don't know if you know this for your testing data , but if you know for your test data , you know , what the string of phones is and and you have them aligned , then you can just instead of going through the net , just create the vector for each phone and feed that in to see if that data helps . Eh , eh , what made me think about this is , I was talking with Hynek and he said that there was a guy at A T - andT who spent eighteen months working on a single feature . And because they had done some cheating experiments Oh , OK . Right , OK , right . And they they had done a cheating experiment or something , right ? and determined that Well , Hynek said that that , I guess before they had him work on this , they had done some experiment where if they could get that one feature right , it dramatically improved the result . So I was thinking , you know it made me think about this , that if it 'd be an interesting experiment just to see , you know , if you did get all of those right . Right . Yeah . Yeah . And then you also don't know what error they 've got on the HTK side . You know ? It sort of gives you your the best you could hope for , kind of ."
