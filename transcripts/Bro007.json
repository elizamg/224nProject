    "transcript": "So combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the MSG features . And so these low - pass filtered goes through M eh another MLP and then the linear output of these two MLP 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this KLT . Um the output is used as uh features as well . Yeah . Yeah so yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard Yeah . @ @ So we have these features from OGI that goes through the three paths . The first is a KLT using several frames of the features . The second path is uh MLP also using nine frames several frames of features The third path is this low - pass filter . Uh , MLP Adding the outputs just like in the second propose the the proposal from for the first evaluation . And then the KLT and then the two together again . Um . So this is yeah Yeah that 's the reason , yeah . For the f the f first yellow line you mean ? Yeah so it 's uh basically s the same except that we don't have this uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams . Well . There 's there 's no low low - pass processing used as additional feature stream . Um Yeah . Uh actually the way things seems to um well it 's uh forty percent for TI - digit , sixty for all the SpeechDat - Cars , well all these languages . Ehm the well match is forty , medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty - five . Yeah . Uh , no . But yeah . Generally what you observe with TI - digits is that the result are very close whatever the the system . Yeah . Uh not yet . No . Mmm yeah , yeah . Mmm . Yeah . So yeah to actually OGI two is the the baseline with the OGI features but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've they 're still made some changes in the features and well but uh actually our results are better than their results . Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results Uh Yeah . Yeah . Yeah there is something funny happening here because yeah . But there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are we are we are around forty - two and but Yeah . So there are some results here uh so the third and the fifth line of the table Filt , yeah Um yeah so it seems f for the the well match and mismatched condition it 's uh it brings something . Uh but uh actually apparently there are there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay . Uh well No . Uh Yeah . Except I don't know because they I think they are still working well . Uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector so but yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side . Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and but well hmm For the moment they have this large delay on the the feature computation and so we don't I th Yeah . Yep . Actually the yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow except that we don't have this KLT on the first on the left part of the diagram . We just have the features as they are . Um Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . It 's included , yeah . Mm - hmm ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , it 's it 's significantly worse well but Mm - hmm . Exc - except for the HM but Uh Um it 's it depends well the well matched is generally larger than the other sets and I think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least . Hmm ? The words , yeah . S sentences . Some sets have five hundred sentences , so . Mmm . Yeah . It it d Seven digits . Mm - hmm ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . We could we could run run some kind of significance tests or Yeah . Yep . Yeah sure sure . Yeah sure . Yeah . Uh Oh yeah I see . Yeah . No they 're I think there is this silence in addition to the um KLT outputs it is because we we we just keep uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the KLT and yeah . So we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions . Uh it 's o it 's OGI two , it 's so the th it 's the features from the first line and yeah . So it 's uh basically this but without the KLT on the from the left path . Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just uh Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mmm . Uh I guess , yeah . I guess , yeah . Mmm . It 's not clear here . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Mmm . Yeah . We can yeah . Sure . But we have to decide I mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best and these But we could it d I think we fixed on Tuesday , yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Uh yeah well . Well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some some other @ @ . Yeah but Mm - hmm . I think you we could we could start soon , yeah . Write up something . Um yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mmm . Uh not really . Um There is the format of the table which is quite impressive . Um it should be the the problem with the error channel error or well , you Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah , so it 's not divided between languages you mean or it just Oh yeah . Yeah . For TI - digits . Yeah , actually yeah . For the TI - digits they want to train on clean and on noisy and yeah . Uh yeah . But uh we actually do we have the features ? Yeah . For the clean TI - digits but we did not test it yet . Uh the clean training stuff . Mmm . Mm - hmm . Hmm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , well . Except if if it 's the thirty - one at midnight or I don't know we can still do some work on Wednesday morning . Yeah , well . Yeah . Mm - hmm . It 's d no . No , we are wondering about the the the hour that we have to eh I don't know if it 's three PM it 's Yeah , it 's it 's midnight but Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Sure . I 'm not sure these are great ideas . Yeah . But Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . I think it 's OK um . We so basically we will I think we 'll try to to focus on these three architectures and and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single KLT because we did not really test that removing all these KLT 's and putting one single KLT at the end . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Transcript three two nine one , three three one zero .
