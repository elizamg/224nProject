    "transcript": "Ri - Yeah , OK , so , um , we 're interested in , um , methods for far mike speech recognition , um , mainly , uh , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal . So , um , one approach would be , um , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one and , um , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . And so we 're interested in , um , comparing the performance of um , a robust approach like MSG with these , um , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches . @ @ And , um , it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that . o o OK , well , um , there was something that was done by , um , a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , um , OK . Who , um , um , it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , um , de - convolution by filtering um , except he used a longer time window , like a second maybe . And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to , um include the whole , um , reverberation um , I don't know what you call it the reverberation response . @ @ I if you see wh if you see what I mean . The reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it 's t got it 's too long in the in the time domain for the um for the RASTA filtering to take care of it . And , um , then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet but have just been tried for enhancement , which , um , have the assumption that um , you can do LPC um analysis of th of the signal you get at the far microphone and the , um , all pole filter that you get out of that should be good . It 's just the , um , excitation signal that is going to be distorted by the reverberation and so you can try and reconstruct a better excitation signal and , um , feed that through the i um , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced ."
