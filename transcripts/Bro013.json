    "transcript": "We 're going ? OK . Sh - Close your door on door on the way out ? Thanks . Yeah . Probably wanna get this other door , too . OK . So . Um . What are we talking about today ? Oh , yeah . That was kind of uh interesting . The both the uh the SRI System and the oth And for one thing that that sure shows the difference between having a lot of uh training data or not , uh , the uh The best kind of number we have on the English uh on near microphone only is is uh three or four percent . And uh it 's significantly better than that , using fairly simple front - ends on on the uh uh , with the SRI system . So I th I think that the uh But that 's that 's using uh a a pretty huge amount of data , mostly not digits , of course , but but then again Well , yeah . In fact , mostly not digits for the actual training the H M Ms whereas uh in this case we 're just using digits for training the H M Ms . Did anybody mention about whether the the SRI system is a is is doing the digits um the wor as a word model or as uh a sub s sub - phone states ? Yeah . Probably . Huh ? Yeah . That 's true . OK . It 's tha it 's that much , huh ? Oh . OK . Still . But but uh what what I think I 'd be interested to do given that , is that we we should uh take I guess that somebody 's gonna do this , right ? is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the SRI system , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Because Yeah , but he 's doing it with the same data , right ? I mean so to So there 's there 's there 's two things being affected . I mean . One is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . We 've been playing a number of states uh I I don't know if he got to the point of playing with the uh number of Gaussians yet but but uh , uh , you know . But , yeah , so far he hadn't gotten any big improvement , but that 's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small . And um . Well , you could do that , but I 'm saying even with it not with that part not retrained , just just using having the H M Ms much better H M Ms . Yeah . Um . But just train those H M Ms using different features , the features coming from our Aurora stuff . So . Well , yeah . I I I 'm sorry . What what is the problem that you 're trying to explain ? That the Oh . So much worse ? Oh . I uh but I 'm I 'm almost certain that it it I mean , that it has to do with the um amount of training data . It it 's it 's orders of magnitude off . But but having a huge If if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data . This is a modest amount of data . So . I mean , ordinarily you would say \" well , given that you have enough occurrences of the digits , you can just train with digits rather than with , you know \" But the thing is , if you have a huge in other words , do word models But if you have a huge amount of data then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar uh allophones . And that 's just a huge amount of training for it . So it 's um I I think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone , it 's really pretty clean data . Um . Now , some of it could be the fact that uh let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ? I mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case . It is if Yeah . Yeah . Cuz this is clean data , and so that 's not too surprising . But um . Uh . So . Uh - huh . Mm - hmm . What kind of numbers are we getting on TI - digits ? Oh . I see . So in the actual TI - digits database we 're getting point eight percent , and here we 're getting three or four three , let 's see , three for this ? Yeah . Sure , but I mean , um point eight percent is something like double uh or triple what people have gotten who 've worked very hard at doing that . And and also , as you point out , there 's adaptation in these numbers also . So if you , you know , put the ad adap take the adaptation off , then it for the English - Near you get something like two percent . And here you had , you know , something like three point four . And I could easily see that difference coming from this huge amount of data that it was trained on . So it 's You know , I don't think there 's anything magical here . It 's , you know , we used a simple HTK system with a modest amount of data . And this is a a , you know , modern uh system uh has has a lot of nice points to it . Um . So . I mean , the HTK is an older HTK , even . So . Yeah it it 's not that surprising . But to me it just it just meant a practical point that um if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should uh Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that 's that 's uh , uh it seems like too large a number , and uh uh people don't necessarily take it so seriously . Um . Yeah . Yeah . So the three point four percent for this uh is is uh So why is it It 's an interesting question though , still . Why is why is it three point four percent for the d the digits recorded in this environment as opposed to the uh point eight percent for for for the original TI - digits database ? Um . Given given the same Yeah . So ignore ignoring the the the SRI system for a moment , just looking at the TI - di the uh tandem system , if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high . It 's , you know , it it 's not awfully high , but it 's , you know it 's it 's high . Um . Why is it uh four times as high , or more ? Right ? I mean , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise . Um . And uh I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over . It was not I mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all . Mm - hmm . Right . Yeah . So I think they were Bless you . I Yeah . I think it 's it 's So . Yes . It 's I think it 's it 's the indication it 's harder . Uh . Yeah and again , you know , i that 's true either way . I mean so take a look at the uh um , the SRI results . I mean , they 're much much better , but still you 're getting something like one point three percent for uh things that are same data as in T TI - digits the same same text . Uh . And uh , I 'm sure the same same system would would get , you know , point point three or point four or something on the actual TI - digits . So this I think , on both systems the these digits are showing up as harder . Um . Which I find sort of interesting cause I think this is closer to uh I mean it 's still read . But I still think it 's much closer to to what what people actually face , um when they 're they 're dealing with people saying digits over the telephone . I mean . I don't think uh I mean , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers , but I don't think that uh the uh the the companies that that do telephone speech get anything like point four percent on their digits . I 'm I 'm I 'm sure they get Uh , I mean , for one thing people do phone up who don't have uh uh Middle America accents and it 's a we we it 's it 's it 's US . it has has many people who sound in many different ways . So . Um . I mean . OK . That was that topic . What else we got ? Did we end up giving up on on , any Eurospeech submissions , or ? I know Thilo and Dan Ellis are are submitting something , but uh . Um . Now , actually for the for the Aur - uh we do have stuff for Aurora , right ? Because because we have ano an extra month or something . Yeah . Well , that 's fine . So th so so we have a couple a couple little things on Meeting Recorder and we have We don't we don't have to flood it with papers . We 're not trying to prove anything to anybody . so . That 's fine . Um . Anything else ? Hmm . Mm - hmm . So wha where did this good VAD come from ? This is the one they had originally ? Oh . Yeah , but they had to get rid of it because of the space , didn't they ? Well . So that 's a problem . Yeah . But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely . I mean , uh i if if there 's a if if I I don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the ETSI folk but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there OK . Determined . I see . But I was thinking that that uh s \" Sure , there may be some interaction , but I don't think we need to be stuck on using our or OGI 's VAD . We could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller or You know , as long as it did the job . So that 's good . Right . Yeah . You didn't gain anything , right ? Mm - hmm . So that means logically , in principle , it should be better . So probably it 'll be worse . Or in the basic perverse nature uh of reality . Yeah . OK . OK . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . Uh - huh . Huh ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Right . Yeah . Uh - huh . Uh . Well , I 'm s uh There 's None of these axes are labeled , so I don't know what this What 's this axis ? Frame . And what 's th what this ? For this one . For the noi Oh . There 's two things on the same graph . So w which is clean and which is noise ? OK . So it 's harder to distinguish but it but it g with noise of course but but Uh . And presumably when there 's a a Uh - huh . Uh - huh . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah Yeah . And this is the difference ? No pre - emphasis ? Yeah . Yeah so it 's doesn't do too well there . Right . So now I wonder I mean , do you want to I know you want to get at something orthogonal from what you get with the smooth spectrum Um . But if you were to really try and get a voiced - unvoiced , do you do you want to totally ignore that ? I mean , do you do you I mean , clearly a a very big very big cues for voiced - unvoiced come from uh spectral slope and so on , right ? Um . Yeah . I see . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Well , you probably want I mean , certainly if you want to do good voiced - unvoiced detection , you need a few features . Each each feature is by itself not enough . But , you know , people look at at slope and uh first auto - correlation coefficient , divided by power . Or or uh um there 's uh I guess we prob probably don't have enough computation to do a simple pitch detector or something ? I mean with a pitch detector you could have a have a an estimate of of what the Uh . Or maybe you could you just do it going through the P FFT 's figuring out some um probable um harmonic structure . Right . And and uh . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Right . Yeah . That 's as as a separate thing . Yeah . Separate thing ? Yeah . Yeah . Maybe so . Um . Yeah . So , what Yeah . What I was talking about was just , starting with the FFT you could you could uh do a very rough thing to estimate estimate uh pitch . And uh uh , given you know , given that , uh you could uh uh come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was was explained by by uh uh those harmonics . Uh . It 's uh a variant on what you 're s what you 're doing . The I mean , the the the mel does give a smooth thing . But as you say it 's not that smooth here . And and so if you if you just you know subtracted off uh your guess of the harmonics then something like this would end up with quite a bit lower energy in the first fifteen hundred hertz or so and and our first kilohertz , even . And um if was uh noisy , the proportion that it would go down would be if it was if it was unvoiced or something . So you oughta be able to pick out voiced segments . At least it should be another another cue . So . Anyway . OK ? That 's what 's going on . Uh . What 's up with you ? Mm - hmm . Hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . Um . I think we 're sort of done . So let 's read our digits and go home . Yeah . No . \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" and \" zero \" are two ways that we say that digit . So it 's so it 's i No . I mean . I think people will do what they say . It 's OK . I mean in digit recognition we 've done before , you have you have two pronunciations for that value , \" O \" and \" zero \" . No , they just write they they write down OH . or they write down ZERO a and they and they each have their own pronunciation . But people wouldn't know what that wa I mean there is no convention for it . See . I mean , you 'd have to tell them \" OK when we write this , say it tha \" , you know , and you just They just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would and and people say it different ways . Yes . That 's right . It was it was spelled out , and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things . That 's also why they 're they 're bunched together in these different groups . So so it 's Yeah . So it 's it 's Everything 's fine . OK . Uh . Transcript L dash three nine . one three two six one zero one four two four seven five nine three eight seven two six two six two seven six seven three four two two two four two nine six four O four O eight eight two eight seven nine nine four O O eight two seven eight zero three nine five one two three eight four three five five nine eight one four two zero two zero nine two nine two six Actually , let me just s since since you brought it up , I was just it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it . But I realized that that um when I 'm talking on the phone , certainly , and and saying these numbers , I almost always say zero . And uh cuz because uh i it 's two syllables . It 's it 's more likely they 'll understand what I said . So that that that 's the habit I 'm in , but some people say \" O \" and Yeah it 's shorter . Yeah . So it 's So . So uh . Now , don't think about it . OK . We 're done ."
