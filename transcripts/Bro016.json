    "transcript": "Hello ? Hello ? Voicing thing . Oh , um . Right . I just , um , continuing looking at , uh , ph uh , phonetic events , and , uh , this Tuesday gonna be , uh , meeting with John Ohala with Chuck to talk some more about these , uh , ph um , phonetic events . Um , came up with , uh , a plan of attack , uh , gonna execute , and um Yeah . It 's that 's pretty much it . Oh , you oh , you want you want details . Hmm . OK . I was hoping I could wave my hands . Um . So , um . So , once wa I I was thinking getting getting us a set of acoustic events to um , to be able to distinguish between , uh , phones and words and stuff . And um , once we we would figure out a set of these events that can be , you know , um , hand - labeled or or derived , uh , from h the hand - labeled phone targets . Um , we could take these events and , um , do some cheating experiments , um , where we feed , um , these events into an SRI system , um , eh , and evaluate its performance on a Switchboard task . Uh , yeah . Yeah . Sure . Um , I I can give you an example of twenty - odd events . Um So , he In this paper , um , it 's talking about phoneme recognition using acoustic events . So , things like frication or , uh , nasality . Um , this is a paper by Hubener and Cardson Benson Bernds - Berndsen . Mm - hmm . Um . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Good . That 's great . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . So . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Um Using these these events , um , you know , we can we can perform these these , uh , cheating experiments . See how how how good they are , um , in , um in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition . And , um and then from that point on , I would , uh , s design robust event detectors , um , in a similar , um , wa spirit that Saul has done w uh , with his graphical models , and this this probabilistic AND - OR model that he uses . Um , eh , try to extend it to , um to account for other other phenomena like , um , CMR co - modulation release . And , um and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models , um , in a data - driven way , uh , similar to the way that , uh , Jeff Jeff , uh , Bilmes did his work . Um , and while I 'm I 'm doing these , um , event detectors , you know , I can ma mea measure my progress by comparing , um , the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like , uh , neural nets . Um , and So so , once we have these these , uh , event detectors , um , we could put them together and and feed the outputs of the event detectors into into the SRI , um , HMM HMM system , and , um and test it on on Switchboard or , um , maybe even Aurora stuff . And , that 's pretty much the the big picture of of um , the plan . Mm - hmm . Hmm . Hmm . OK . OK .
