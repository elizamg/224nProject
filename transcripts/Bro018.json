    "transcript": "So . Yeah , I will try to explain the thing that I did this this week during this week . Well eh you know that I work I begin to work with a new feature to detect voice - unvoice . What I trying two MLP to to the with this new feature and the fifteen feature uh from the eh bus base system No , satly the mes the Mel Cepstrum , the new base system the new base system . Yeah , we yeah the Aurora system with the new filter , VAD or something like that . And I 'm trying two MLP , one one that only have t three output , voice , unvoice , and silence , and other one that have fifty - six output . The probabilities of the allophone . And I tried to do some experiment of recognition with that and only have result with with the MLP with the three output . And I put together the fifteen features and the three MLP output . And , well , the result are li a little bit better , but more or less similar . Voice , unvoice , and si The feature the input ? The inputs are the fifteen the fifteen uh bases feature . the with the new code . And the other three features are R , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum , the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the the first point , because half the height value is R - zero and also R - zero , the first coefficient of the auto - correlation function . That is like the energy with these three feature , also these three feature . Yeah . Uh yeah . No , R c No . Auto - correlation ? Yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that @ @ Yeah , I I 'll The spectral shape , yeah . No , I don't use that I can't use Mmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm , OK . Yeah , yeah . Well , I can also th use this . Bec - because the result are a little bit better but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar more or less similar . It 's not quite better . Yeah , I used this too . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I have yeah . No Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Maybe . Ah I 'm sorry . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Oh , not too much . Mmm , one day or less . Eh fifty - f six uh no , the frame error rate ? Fifty - six I think . Percent . The accuracy . Mm - hmm . No for , yes f I don't remember for voice - unvoice , maybe for the other one . for voiced . I don't reme Better . Maybe for voice - unvoice . This is for the other one . I should I can't show that . But I think that fifty - five was for the when the output are the fifty - six phone . That I look in the with the other nnn the other MLP that we have are more or less the same number . Silence will be better but more or less the same . I think that I I I think that for the other one , for the three output , is sixty sixty - two , sixty three more or less . It 's Yeah . Yeah , because it 's noise also . And we have I know . Yeah , yeah , yeah . will be Yeah . Well I don't know , but I th I I think that we I have the result more or less . Maybe . I don't know . I don't I 'm not sure but I remember @ @ that I can't show that . Yeah . Mm - hmm . I will do that . But Uh , no . TIMIT . Yeah . Yeah this for TIMIT . Noisy TIMIT . We have noisy TIMIT with the noise of the the TI - digits . And now we have another noisy TIMIT also with the noise of uh Italian database . This is the work that I did during this date and also mmm I H Hynek last week say that if I have time I can to begin to to study well seriously the France Telecom proposal to look at the code and something like that to know exactly what they are doing because maybe that we can have some ideas but not only to read the proposal . Look insi look i carefully what they are doing with the program @ @ and I begin to to work also in that . But the first thing that I don't understand is that they are using R - the uh log energy that this quite I don't know why they have some constant in the expression of the lower energy . I don't know what that means . Yeah . This Yeah . Then maybe I can understand . Because maybe they 're the threshold that they are using on the basis of this value I don't know exactly , because well th I thought maybe they have a meaning . But I don't know what is the meaning of take exactly this value . Yeah , the e The effect I don't @ @ I can understand the effect of this , no ? because it 's to to do something like that . No ? Mm - hmm . Yeah . Well . I I will look to try if I move this parameter in their code what happens , maybe everything is Maybe they tres hole are on basis of this . I don't know . Mm - hmm . I this more or less anything I think that Stephane will arrive today or tomorrow . Mm - hmm . He 's I think that he is in Las Vegas or something like that . Yeah . Yeah .
