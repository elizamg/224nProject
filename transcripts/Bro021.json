    "transcript": "Uh , OK . Well , in my lunch talk last week I I said I 'd tried phase normalization and gotten garbage results using that l um , long - term mean subtraction approach . It turned out there was a bug in my Matlab code . So I tried it again , um , and , um , the results were were better . I got intelligible speech back . But they still weren't as good as just subtracting the magnitude the log magnitude means . And also I 've been talking to , um , Andreas and Thilo about the , um , SmartKom language model and about coming up with a good model for , um , far mike use of the SmartKom system . So I 'm gonna be working on , um , implementing this mean subtraction approach in the far - mike system for the SmartKom system , I mean . And , um , one of the experiments we 're gonna do is , um , we 're gonna , um , train the a Broadcast News net , which is because that 's what we 've been using so far , and , um , adapt it on some other data . Um , An - Andreas wants to use , um , data that resembles read speech , like these digit readings , because he feels that the SmartKom system interaction is not gonna be exactly conversational . S so actually I was wondering , how long does it take to train that Broadcast News net ? Two , three weeks . Oh . OK . OK . OK . Mm - hmm . And , um , actually , regarding the phase normalization So I did two experiments , and one is So , phases get added , modulo two pi , and because you only know the phase of the complex number t t to a value modulo two pi . And so I thought at first , um , that , uh , what I should do is unwrap the phase because that will undo that . Um , but I actually got worse results doing that unwrapping using the simple phase unwrapper that 's in Matlab than I did not unwrapping at all . And that 's all I have to say . OK . Oh . Oh . OK .
