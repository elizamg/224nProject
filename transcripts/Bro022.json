    "transcript": "OK . OK . So should I go so that , uh , you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ? OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal . So , um Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a as a middle step . And , um , I hope to hope to get this , um a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan . Um , my meeting with , uh ? Oh , oh , you mean the the quals . Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth . Yeah . D - Day . Uh - huh . Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um then everybody asks you questions . Yeah . Yep . So , um . Y s Oh . Uh , a little bit about ? Oh , the the Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with with a reasonable set . Something something like , um , um like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then and then reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again . Um , for that for that part of the the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT . And , um , then after after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ? Um , that 's that 's , um that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd I would be able to , um to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for that for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for for Switchboard . And I 'd run some some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers . Yeah . That 's why I I was asking about that . Yeah . Um , and I guess that 's that 's it . Any any questions ? Um , yeah . A few more . It 's a it 's a month and and a week . Yeah . Oh . Hmm ! That 's with the new IIR filters ? OK . Uh , gets rid of the speech . Oh , wow . Yeah . Yeah . SRI . Hmm . Hmm . Mm - hmm . Transcript L dash two one four . Seven five three , nine five nine , one three five two . Five three five , one O one , O six seven .
