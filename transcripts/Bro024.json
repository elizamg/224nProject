    "transcript": "Yeah , OK . Um , so for the past , uh , week an or two , I 've been just writing my , uh , formal thesis proposal . Um , so I 'm taking this qualifier exam that 's coming up in two weeks . And I I finish writing a proposal and submit it to the committee . Um . And uh , should I should I explain , uh , more about what what I 'm proposing to do , and s and stuff ? OK . Um , so briefly , I 'm proposing to do a n a new p approach to speech recognition using um , a combination of , uh , multi - band ideas and ideas , um , about the uh , acoustic phonec phonetic approach to speech recognition . Um , so I will be using these graphical models that um , that implement the multi - band approach to recognize a set of intermediate categories that might involve , uh , things like phonetic features or other other f feature things that are more closely related to the acoustic signal itself . Um , and the hope in all of this is that by going multi - band and by going into these , um intermediate classifications , that we can get a system that 's more robust to to unseen noises , and situations like that . Um , and so , some of the research issues involved in this are , um , one , what kind of intermediate categories do we need to classify ? Um , another one is um , what what other types of structures in these multi - band graphical models should we consider in order to um , combine evidence from the sub - bands ? And , uh , the third one is how do we how do we merge all the , uh , information from the individual uh , multi - band classifiers to come up with word word recognition or or phone recognition things . Um , so basically that 's that 's what I 've been doing . And , I got two weeks to brush up on d um , presentation stuff and , um , But . Oh , that too . Yeah . Yes . Yes . I , um I 'm I 'm gonna do some . Would you be interested ? To help out ? OK . Thanks . Yeah . That 's it . Yeah . Is this is this VAD a MLP ? OK . How how big is it ? OK .
