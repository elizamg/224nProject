    "transcript": "OK , so We we had a meeting with , uh with Hynek , um , in in which , uh , uh , Sunil and Stephane , uh summarized where they were and and , uh , talked about where we were gonna go . So that that happened sort of mid - week . Uh . What was the update ? Yeah . I think it more likely that what it means is that when Sunil is up there he will grab it . They 're Yeah . They 're working on a different task . But what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , uh , Pratibha will come back from from , uh , the east coast . Uh . And , uh and and I guess actually , uh , after Eurospeech for a little bit , uh , he 'll go up there too . So , actually everybody who 's working on it will be up there for at least a little while . So they 'll remotely access it from there . Yeah . Good idea . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , for this stuff I don't think we 're quite up to that . I mean , we 're still so much in development . We want to have just the insiders . Yeah . Yeah . So , uh Well , I mean , I think maybe the thing to me might be I me I 'm sure you 've just been working on on , uh , details of that since the meeting , right ? And so That was that was Tuesday . OK . But I guess maybe the thing since you weren't yo you guys weren't at that that meeting , might be just just to , um , sort of recap , uh , the the conclusions of the meeting . So . Yeah . Cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , uh , he would come here this week and and we would sort of Since he 's going out of town like now , and I 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? And , uh and what do we freeze ? And , you know , what do we ? So , um . I mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part . So then there 's something central and there aren't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . Uh , um , and , um , and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . So keep a certain set of things constant . So , um . Uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now , or ? This this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ? Oh , it 's on the transfer function for the Wiener filter . Yeah , OK . Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . This module , in principle , i I mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it . I mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , right ? So , um . Uh , well you don't I guess you don't re - synthesize speech , but you could Uh , but you could . But you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here . Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . But for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well . So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . And , uh , generate new files or whatever , and and , uh , uh and then do the reverberation part . So it 's Anyway . No , no . He 's I mean , e a Yeah , prelims , right . Yeah . So . Uh , but but , you know , that 'll uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we can't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . And that 's hard enough . I mean , I don't think we really I mean , we 're trying to deal with that . In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task . And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . Uh , even that 's hard enough . And and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around . But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . So we have to start Since any almost any real situation is gonna have uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we we actually have to think about both at the same time . So , um So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have . So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the FFT level . Then Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . The the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ? Yeah , OK . And then the mel and then the log , and then the LDA filter . And then uh downsample , DCT , on - line norm , Right , and then in parallel with an a neural net . And then following neural net , some probably some orthogonalization . Uh Um . Mm - hmm . So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . Yeah . So the things that we , um , uh , I guess we sort of uh , There 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for V A Ds So , I mean , in I think there 's sort of like There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . There 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . And there 's gonna be a host of those . But structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gonna need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a a significantly better VAD , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , opening up the second front . Uh . Yeah , yeah , I mean , cuz we we have we have , uh , uh , half the the , uh , data rate that they allow . And , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south was , uh , that , um , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one . It 's , you know , cheap , easy . Uh . There 's a question about exactly how we do it . We probably will go to something better later , but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently , so . Um , I think Tony Robinson used to do I was saying this before . I think he used to do mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra . He used them as alternate features . Put them together . Uh . Although you you know , you haven't tested it actually on the German and Danish , have you ? Yeah . Yeah . Would it I mean But When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without German and Danish ? Yeah , OK . Well ranking didn't before , but I 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the German and Danish , right ? So . Oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were I mean , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems . And so , I guess by that we were third , but I mean , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place . Uh , so institutionally we were we were second , with , uh , the third third system . See Uh , no I think it 's also institutional , isn't it ? Right ? I mean , I think both of their systems probably Oh , are we ? Is it ? Yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close . And and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things . Uh , I mean , one could argue about the LDA and so forth but I I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . But what what Um , why are we using half ? Well , so you could you c Yeah , so I I think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong , but I I think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . Uh , they have some cepstral modification , right ? In our case we have a couple things . We have the on - line normalization and then we have the LDA RASTA . And they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . But in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . But there 's one difference . The LDA RASTA , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies . And they 're not doing that . So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample . So Yeah . I think it doesn't affect it , does it ? Yeah . So I think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information . And , uh , so I you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot . So that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though I 'm saying I think we could do much better , just because it 's simple . Um . And you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , \" oh , yeah , I understand \" , is is very helpful . Well , that 's a question . I mean , we were talking about that . It looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise , um , and , uh , Yeah . So , I mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion . There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . Uh . I sort of think you should , but I don't know . Right . Uh . Well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ? Yeah , probably . Some kind would be good . You know ? I would think . If you do or don't normalize ? Right . Yes , so I mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . But I I w w My thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it . And then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , \" OK , this much effect \" I mean , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens . You want to change them one at a time . So adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way . And then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . Normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot . So , I would think you would wanna have some baseline that says , \" OK , we don't normalize , this is what we get \" , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . But but the other question is So I think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization . I agree . No , it 's in parallel . We 're not talking about computation time here . We 're ta I think we 're pretty far out . So it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on . It 's depending on the same data as the other . So it 's in parallel . Uh - huh . Yeah . Well , there 's the delays and the storage , yeah . But I don't think the storage is so big for that . I think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net . Right ? Yeah . Um . And so I guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based TRAPS , and and how big are they ? So that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue . Maybe they can be little ones . Mini - TRAPS . Right . And maybe for VAD they would be OK . Yeah . Yeah . That 's true . Or a simple neural net , right ? I mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . And so , uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . It certainly doesn't take much space . So , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? Do you need to have an added layer or something ? In which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big . So . So , uh , uh So what 's next ? Maybe s s remind us . What to freeze and then what to do after we froze . Yeah . And like I was saying , I think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh I mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . And then , uh , improving the VAD . Uh . So . Right . Right . Um . Have you ever ? Very good question . Have you ever worked with the Mississippi State h uh , software ? Oh . Well you you may be called upon to help , uh , uh , on account of , uh , all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary . Do we already have it ? Maybe you could , uh , point it at Chuck , because , I mean Cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , uh , all the digit stuff , uh , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , uh , tweak Joe about or whatever , because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff . S Yeah , so I th th certainly the thing that I would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . Yeah , yeah . Uh , in which case , um , H Hari or Hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this . Um . Yes . In this case , that 's right . That 's right . Um , some of that may be , uh , a last minute rush thing because if the if our features are changing Uh . Uh . But , um . Yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , uh , it 's starting to seem to me now like November fifteenth is right around the corner . And , um , if they haven't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gonna be for this , uh , when \" deciding \" is not just somebody deciding . I mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . It it it seems pretty tight to me . That 's when the evaluation is . Yeah . So , yeah , so after But , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . It wouldn't , you know , entirely surprise me . But , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , I 'm I 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . That would be , uh put us in an awkward position . But Anyway . Great . Yeah , I think that 'll be helpful . There 's there 's not anybody OGI currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this and and I I think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do . I mean , I think that it it is Uh . Yeah . Well , I mean , it 's it 's Conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if I 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check . That you haven't come across you haven't invented features which are actually gonna do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . And , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . So it 's it 's a double check . So they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight . Yeah . But , I mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with . Uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , right ? It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . So you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect . And , um , it wouldn't surprise me if they did something like that with this . So again , if you 're if you get If it doesn't help you much , uh , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , uh , you know , it may not hurt you that much . But if it if you don't if it doesn't help you much at all , um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , uh , if their strategies do , then That 's it . Yeah . Yeah . So we have the data , just not the recognizer . OK . Uh , well there 's training and test , right ? No , I mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it . So I wouldn't So it it 's So , training the recognizer , but , um Um . But I think it 's trained on clean and Is it trained on clean and and test on ? Yeah . OK . I see . Yeah . Yeah . I mean , I wouldn't imagine that the amount of testing data was that huge . They probably put training uh , almost certain they put training data there too . Maybe not . So . That 's that . Anybody have anything else ? Oh , well that 's pretty soon . You know , their their They have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the SVM is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . For the most part it 's it 's Gaussian mixtures . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , the SVM thing was an HMM also . It was just a it it it was like a hybrid , like what ? Yeah . Hmm . Yeah , um . In fact , I mean , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable You know Joe , right ? Yeah . Just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on . So that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors and what 's what 's the plan about that ? Yeah . Is that OK ? Uh , yeah , and just , um , se maybe see . Do you have Hari 's , uh ? Yeah , so maybe just CC Hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here , and , uh , you know , end . Uh . Why don't you just ask Joe but CC Hari , and then in the note say , \" Hari , hopefully this is OK with you \" . And then if Joe feels like he needs a confirmation , Hari can answer it . That way you can get started asking Joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and doing that stuff Yeah . Have you thought about how long would be uh , most useful for you to go up to OGI ? Oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? I mean , it 's to you . I ju you guys are Well , y anyway , you don't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . I 'll support it either way , so . OK . Uh . Got anything to tell us ? Mm - hmm . Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is is , again , looking at the same representation , I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . That that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is that I wonder about with it , and and don't take this in the wrong way , like I I know what I 'm doing or anything , but , I mean . Um , just wondering really . Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . Um , and I don't know if that I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" and \" puh \" differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . So , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , screwing up on this distinction . So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? \" Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? So these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it . Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . But , you know and and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh Um , anyway . That 's my thought . You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . And you 've been thinking about it more now , these categories . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . Well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , right ? And Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . You know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um , metric of of goodness , uh , i if our correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . I mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . But , words aren't bad , yeah . And and Yeah . But but but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough I mean , what you wanna do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition . And and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . In some way I mean , we derive that all the time . In some ways it 's really not a bad bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal . Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit , uh , and uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it Right . Yeah . Yeah . Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is , um i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true . If you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , for the most part . So so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier and and and , uh , the phones are uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of and , um And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon that Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it ? I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes don't get heard . And if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , um , I don't know , I w I would I would guess that you 'd W I don't know . Anyway , that 's Mm - hmm . Well that Oh , sure , that 's really big . Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are . So , I mean , that 's i Right . We can't we can't get it at all without any language models . Language models are there and important but but , uh Uh . If we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it , but especially if it looks like the potential is there . So Should we do some digits ? Since we 're here ?
