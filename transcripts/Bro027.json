    "transcript": "OK , we 're going . This is for ASRU . You mean , from the actual , uh , recordings ? It 's nine DB ? Hmm . So that 's on th that 's on the f the far field ones though , right ? Yeah . So wha what is , uh what 's causing that ? Yeah . Uh - huh . Yeah . Hmm . Mm - hmm . I see . Mmm . When are his prelims ? Oh . Wow . So , I Huh . I I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester but they 'll do it any time , huh ? Is it already ? Yikes . Yeah . I , um uh , started working on the uh Mississippi State recognizer . So , I got in touch with Joe and and , uh , from your email and things like that . And , uh , they added me to the list uh , the mailing list . And he gave me all of the pointers and everything that I needed . And so I downloaded the , um There were two things , uh , that they had to download . One was the , uh , I guess the software . And another wad was a , um , sort of like a sample a sample run . So I downloaded the software and compiled all of that . And it compiled fine . No problems . And , um , I grabbed the sample stuff but I haven't , uh , compiled it . No Well , I haven't grabbed that one yet . So there 's two . There was another short one , yeah . And so I haven't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . So . Um , but , the software seemed to compile fine and everything , so . And , um , So . No , I I d You asked me to write to him and I think I forgot to ask him about that . Or if I did ask him , he didn't reply . I I don't remember yet . Uh , I 'll I 'll d I 'll double check that and ask him again . Yeah . Yeah . Maybe I 'll send it to the list . Yeah . Uh - huh . OK , I haven't seen that one yet . So . OK . And so they 've picked the values . Oh , OK . OK . Yeah . Yeah , OK . Do you think that 's something I should just send to him or do you think I should send it to this there 's an a m a mailing list . OK . Yeah . OK . Yeah . Right . OK . Yeah . OK . Yeah . Yep . Yeah . Yeah , i that was a particular version . Yeah , SUSI or whatever it was but we don't have that . So . Should be OK . Yeah , it compiled fine actually . No no errors . Nothing . So . Hmm . Who 's the second Jeff ? No . Oh , OK . Oh , OK . Wow . That would be neat . Hmm . Is that nine frames u s uh , centered around the current frame ? Or So , I 'm I 'm s so what is different between this and and what you Ah . OK . Wow . What if you used a smaller window for the delta ? Could that help a little bit ? I mean , I guess there 's a lot of things you could do to Is two hundred the d i a hun uh Wh - what 's the baseline you need to be under ? Two hundred ? Oh . So , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ? Uh - huh . Oh , OK , I see . Ah , OK . But still , that 's that 's a pretty big , uh , win . And it doesn't seem like you 're in terms of your delay , you 're , uh , that Yeah , that 's what it seems like to me . It 's pretty good . Where where is this where is this fifty - seven point O two in in comparison to the last evaluation ? Oh , is that right ? Oh . Wow . So this is almost ten percent . Wow . This is this is really good . Yeah . What was that ? Say that last part again ? Mmm . So that would be even That wouldn't change this number down here to sixty - two ? Yeah . Yeah . So that 's sort of the best you could hope for . I see . Those are th those are th what is going into the tandem net ? Those two ? Yeah ? Oh , oh . OK . I see . Uh - huh . Right . OK . Compared to these numbers ? That 's how you get down to twenty - eight ? Why twenty - eight ? Oh . Ah . I see . Yeah . That makes sense . So , it seems funny that I don't know , maybe I don't u quite understand everything , but that adding features I guess I guess if you 're keeping the back - end fixed . Maybe that 's it . Because it seems like just adding information shouldn't give worse results . But I guess if you 're keeping the number of Gaussians fixed in the recognizer , then Yeah . Uh - huh . Oh , yeah , I wasn't necessarily saying it should be better . I 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel On the highly mismatch . Yeah . Huh . What if you did the Would it make sense to do the KLT on the full set of combined features ? Instead of just on the Oh , I see . So you tried the global KLT before and it didn't really I see . Uh - huh . Uh - huh . What is the You said there was a limit of sixty features or something ? What 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ? So I I I don't understand , because i I mean , if you 're only using h Uh - huh . So you 're saying , add the Macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? The tandem net ? Yeah . Right . What what was it trained on again ? The one that you used ? Uh - huh . And and did an other numbers stay the same ? Insertion substitutions stay the same ? Roughly ? Uh - huh . Well that that says that , you know , the , um the models in in , uh , the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features . Uh . You know , I 've been wondering about something . In the , um a lot of the , um the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . and and they , um They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . So there 's the the LDA is is right there before the H M Ms . So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . Yeah . Uh - huh . Yeah , you c you c you can . I mean , it 's you know , you 're just basically i You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . Ah . OK . So what i what about , um i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? Yeah . Right , it 's the It 's Right . The So Yeah , so it 's sort of like The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . I g Yeah . But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , Uh - huh . Yeah . Right . Uh - huh . Yeah . Uh - huh . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Right . So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that Yeah , right . Right . Right . Yeah . Well y Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering I I Yeah . Um . No . That 's what that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing . So . We just want to show . I mean , it everybody believes it , but you know , we just Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , but . Yeah , what I mean is it 's it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , you know , LDA on their features . And so . Uh . Yeah , so it 's different . Yeah , exactly . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that that you guys have . So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . I don't know . I I don't know enough about it , but Um . What Do y do you have that feature available for the test data ? Oh , oh , I see . I see . OK . OK . So you 're saying , feed that , also , into the neural net . Yeah . Yeah . Right . But in principle wouldn't it be better to feed it in ? And let the net do that ? Hmm . Yeah . What what if you Right . So , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? Well , I guess that 's the same . Uh , that 's similar . But I mean I mean , train the net only on But I mean , if you 're gonna if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision , uh , would then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction , right ? Ah . Right , OK . That 's a good point . Be interesting to look at the Yeah , for the I wonder if you could do this . But if you look at the , um , highly mism high mismat the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at , you know , the distribution versus the the other ones , do you do you see more peaks or something ? Yeah . But if you were gonna put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? Ah . OK . Right . For the tandem net you mean ? Hmm . So if , uh if the , uh , high mismatch case had been more like the , uh , the other two cases in terms of giving you just a better performance , how would this number have changed ? y Like sixty ? Uh - huh . Yeah . So this would be sixty - two ? Which is All the other ones were five percent , the Yeah . Hmm . When When do you leave ? But you 're are you you 're not gonna be around this afternoon ? Oh . Uh - huh . Ah , OK , OK . What 's September sixth ? Oh , oh , right . OK . So , uh , you 're gonna be gone for the next three weeks or something ? So that 's you won't be at the next three of these meetings . Is that right ? Oh , right . Right . OK . When do you go back ? When is the evaluation ? November , or something ? Yeah . Should we do digits ? Transcript L dash three five two . Five seven six four , five six seven zero , four six nine three .
