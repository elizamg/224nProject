    "transcript": "Yeah , that 's right ! Thanks . So . There 's a switch on top . So . \" On - off \" . The the wireless ones are actually labeled . They have a little piece of tape . That 's r exactly the problem . Subtract one from the mike number to get the channel number . Or maybe add one . Of course . So I guess I am channel eight . You look ni You look nine . Funny , you don't look a day over seven . Yeah , so it 's r it 's remarkable how quickly people forget . So far , e You h you must have much better ear . And so far every meeting I 've recorded someone has at one point or another said , \" Oh , I probably shouldn't have said that . \" So I think they 're they 're Well , I I bet they 're recorded quite loudly . Yeah , so it That 's a nice user interface , Dan . Very what does \" solo \" mean ? Ah ! Oh , but it doesn't actually do anything else ? Oh , yeah , that 's right . Yeah , I think a lot o a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up . I kn and , uh , just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it . This this thing ? Or or just that one ? Yeah . So so the I think Yeah . Oh , yeah . But this is very comfortable . I mean , I I could wear this without any difficulty . I We c we 'd we 'd have to buy new ones . The the other wa the other way I had it , which might work , is you put one over an ear and then you can adjust the other one . And that didn't that seemed to be pretty That doesn't work for you ? So so you see how Jane 's wearing it ? That seems to work OK too . And you just have to bring it up . Well , except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth . So . Mm - hmm . Right . So . Yeah , we maybe we should look into if we can buy a replacement . If they 're eighty bucks , that might be worth doing cuz they 're very uncomfortable . Well , I mean , what you 'd rather do is nothing at all , of course , but to get to get a good quality I mean , if if you were listening to it downstairs , that one 's quite a bit lower quality . So . Yeah . Yeah . Well well try this one on . Because I find this one doesn't bother me at all . I think you forget pretty quick . Um , I guess the other reason is I used Well , I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a corpus not for an actual end - user application . And so I think a little bit of intrusion is not ridiculous . Yeah , I agree . Training s Training speech recognition systems . We wanna do both . So so the the point is that if you if we try , from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything . You won't be able to align . You won't be able to segment . You won't be able to do anything . Right ! Well , I mean , we haven't done the the detail experiment but just from listening to it , it 's pretty bad , whereas these are m are very good . I mean , that 's why That 's why if you if you use DragonDictate or or ViaVoice , or any of those others to do dictation you need to use these . There 's just no other way around it . Well , and as I said , I find this one I find this one is no problem at all . The only thing is a little bit of audio a a little bit of audio degradation in one ear , and I get a little bit of peripheral vision , but other than that , it 's not bad at all . Those , on the other hand , are very uncomfortable . So . That 's right . So I I guess you know , maybe the problem is we got the kid 's version . It 's wired . Whereas I used speech recognition for about four years using one of these , so I 'm used to this . I don't use it anymore . Uh , my hands got better so I stopped using it . But , uh . So , for about four years I used DragonDictate and NaturallySpeaking to do all my work . Yeah . It was really a pain . Yeah , but I didn't have a choice . I mean , I couldn't type . So , uh . Yeah . In fact , when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on , \" voice environments for programmers \" , but we couldn't get any funding for it and my hands got better . So that 's how I ended up working on this project instead . Anyway . So so what are you guys doing ? What 's your project ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . Mm - hmm . Worse acoustics . Yeah . Mmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . So . Yeah . This is this is The PDA one is very , very ambitious . And it 's also it 's depending on not only that Uh , not only does it depend on IRAM taping out and working as specified , it also depends on writing vectorized speech recognition algorithms which is non - trivial . So . Right , I mean , so so one of our our back off policy on that if if there 's problems with IRAM is it 'll be a wireless link , right ? You 'll dump the the dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere and you 'll do the recognition . Mm - hmm . Hmm . Well , we we we 've had a lot of discussions about it and I think maybe I think t to some extent it comes down to a religious issue . My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad . And so if you can get away with it , I don't want to have a terminal in my hand and a mainframe somewhere else . Um , the too many things to cont can go wrong and you lack control . I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself . And so the IRAM project provided us a method of having a very powerful thing in your hand . And so we wanna see what we can do with it but we 'd also don't want the project to actually completely depend on it . So , the project will go forward regardless of whether IRAM works or not . Right . So w Mm - hmm . So a Right . Mm - hmm . Right , so the so for us the Meeting Recorder project has a very similar uh , approach . Me personally , for my P H D thesis , I 'm sorta doing the other way and seeing how much speech recognition can I do on this little unit . Yep . Yep . That 's right . So so the As I said , the Meeting Recorder project , so we have people at UW , people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations . They won't be running on IRAM . And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM . Mm - hmm . Right . That 's right , we don't even know what to do with it . We don't need to n Right . Yeah . Yep . Yeah , we don't even know what to do with their cycles . We w Like As an example , we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID , acoustic change detection . And he has a very good system for that and and he wants to use this corpus . So . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Oh , it th what 's nice about What 's nice about getting this corpus is , i with the people wired you have a excellent baseline . Right ? You have a very easy problem and you can get the right answer , to ground truth very easily and then you can degrade it by using the P Z Ms , you can degrade it further by using those things . And and really see what you can do with a real system . So . That 's right . That 's right . Oh , really ? They 're doing an unknown number ? That 's good . I mean , just mixing it wouldn't work because the channel characteristics are too different . So , uh , what we what we were working on here was parts of Broadcast News . And so that that 's a slightly strange task because they tend to be long segments . But they were they were parts that were interviews that he worked on . And , uh . Right . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah , he had he got very good results . Right . Right . Yeah , so I I tried his on his system on the Meeting Recorder stuff , um , but of course we don't have any trained neural nets or , uh So so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system that we use for speech recognition . And so , uh , I was using the Broadcast News nets on this data . So of course it didn't do didn't do t tremendously well . And then the other problem also was that it doesn't handle overlap very well , his algorithm . Hmm ? Right . That 's right , with all the i interrupts . Yes . Mixing , yeah . Like McLaughlin. But yeah , they they have I think in in Oh , I 'm sure they do . They I 'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back . Well , but that that 's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters . Right ? Mm - hmm . High involvement . That 's that 's a good way of saying it . So what do we do ? It seems like there 's a lot of overlap between our projects , so it would be nice to work together . Mm - hmm . So is your intention to start collecting some meeting data ? Mm - hmm . More data is better . Oh . Mm - hmm . Right . So what would be nice is if we could , uh , converge on on formats and conventions , and so on , and software . I mean , just Right . I , uh uh It shouldn't be done . Yes . We 're talking about that right now . I 'm not sure how much I should say about it . So that the , uh there 's some possibility that we 're gonna get a third c party company to do the transcription for us in exchange for the corpus . Right , and We have a little bit of DARPA . Uh , under the communicator project . So so that 's part of it . And then , uh , part of it 's on the IRAM group . IRAM group is paying for part of it . And then part of it 's just ICSI general funds , is paying for it as well . The infrastructure , yeah , they th they were paid but they don't expect anything in return . They 're just being very nice and good neighbors and and so they they basically wanted stuff anyway . And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed . So . And to our listening audience . Feedback . Right . We we talked about that and It was Well i w when I spoke with him he he really just said it was a money issue . That it 's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue where we 're perfectly willing to give people those boxes . The boxes are cheap . Um , but , you know , can they afford to get a six channel Sony wireless and can they afford the P Z Ms , and that sort of stuff . Well Oh . This is this is the same same company that may be doing the transcripts for us , may be giving us may be giving us , uh - huh . Yeah . And it would also it would be really nice to be able to do it in other rooms , cuz otherwise we 're gonna learn a lot about this air conditioning . Yes . That 'd be great . Yeah , I agree . So so are you gonna m uh , i is there gonna be some sort of mark for that ? I mean , are they gonna say , \" Computer , bring up a web page on \" or ? Uh - huh . Oh , I see . I 'm just thinking , from a discourse point of view it 'd be very interesting to somehow mark \" I 'm talking to the computer \" . Right . \" Computer , show me a web page on X , \" return . Are you talking to me ? Are you talking to me ? XML , that solves everything . Uh - huh . That 's right . We 're gonna make Right . Someone will make some assumption that 's different than someone else . And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate . Yep . So that 's something we should try to I I 'm not sure what wh I mean what 's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in touch with each other . Right . Yeah . Uh - huh . Yeah , I mean , meetings like this are good because we can actually record them . Yep , absolutely . Right . So When you 're talking about your artificial meetings , i they are gonna be goal directed , though . So they 're gonna s say , you 're you 're having a meeting to do this . Mm - hmm . Oh . So that will be different . Oh . So if You 're double miking everyone , so that 's a close talking and a lapel , and then two environmental mikes , is that right ? Right . Well , if you ha m u eh Mm - hmm . Yeah that That is , uh . Yes , or drinking . Y getting getting coffee on these is definitely a bad thing . Wizard of Oz . So a real computer but a w uh , someone driving it . Yeah , I I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training uh , the acoustic models , without any question . Oh , absolutely . Yeah , cuz if you don't the the accuracy 's gonna be horrendously bad . So . Well , we 'll definitely need to do both . Right . It it really i It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that . So . I Well it 's just as an example , I I 've done some very simple digits recognitions where , uh , I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have done this before , uh . Having people read digit strings cuz digits are much easier . Um . And just combining just doing multis Yeah , of course . Yeah . But , uh , just mixing the just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously . And I was a little surprised . Yeah , so you so you Wh - why ? I have no idea . Because they 're a little different . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . And that actually helped . That gave several percent improvement . Absolute . So that , uh , I think just just having stereo will help cuz they 're a little different . You get a little slightly different estimators and , uh , uh , you combine them together , and you do a little better . Right , so that the M So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours . And then U W is talking about doing an additional sixty to a hundred hours if they have the money . If they can actually do it . I mean , that 's what they had said before but I guess that was more ambitious . Uh - huh . Yeah , recording it 's easy . It 's transcription that 's a pain . OK , but you have to put on a You have to put on a mike . Oh . We 're out of mikes . Don't don't switch mikes . Don't switch mikes . That 's way too confusing . Mm - hmm . But if you had the data and we had a a company . I didn't know whether I should name the company that may be providing us transcription or not . IBM . So we 've been we 've been trying we 've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects and they don't it 's hard for them to give us money but they they seem to be willing to give us time . And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus . It would be great . Yeah . Yes , absolutely . I think that would be excellent . Mm - hmm . That 's right . Morgan says thumbs up . Well , and I think that So al Right . Mm - hmm . So so how are you gonna get dra ground truth on that ? So so we should Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But anyway , what I was gonna say is that although we 're not gonna have speech directed to a computer , my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar . The language models probably won't be . Yeah , I if it 's Wizard of Oz I think it will be . If they know that Yeah . The language model will be certainly be different but Mm - hmm . And you 're gonna hand c hand - code that ? Oh , I I uh sure , sure , sure , sure . I see . Right , if you wanna interpret it you uh need to do do that anyway . So what 's your time frame look like for doing meetings , actually starting to record some ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Well the the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions . Um . Well , yeah , it 's a it 's ex excellent , excellent . Yeah , that 's right . I mean , just just just agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits , and , uh , header formats and all that . Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz ? Eh , good good . Big endian , little endian ? Well , but that 's that was coincidence , right ? So I I think probably the biggest thing would Well , no that that wouldn't be true . If you 're not gonna transcribe it yourself , then you 're not gonna care too much about our transcription conventions . Right of it . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Right . Well Well , so it 's a so it seems like , um , if you and Jane Yeah . So if you and Jane keep keep in touch about transcription conventions , that would be very helpful . Yeah . Yep . Hmm . That 's right . Right . It 's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it . Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription , I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using . That 's alright . He can talk anyway . I was . LDC is what we were thinking too . Hmm . Robert 's rules . Well I think that Mm - hmm . Hmm . There are certainly f formal meeting settings where that 's what 's happens , y that you know , Robert 's rules of order and all that . Uh , so that 's not something we had thought about before but I think it it it certainly is another type of meeting that could be done . Uh , no , I didn't . I didn't know we were gonna be recording this meeting , so I didn't . Yes , in the other meetings we have . So that 's another thing we should talk about , is making sure that we 're doing it in the same way . So I I Yeah , if I had known and here we have all these new speakers , I could have gotten lots of digits in but No , no , I have people read them . Seven . Oh , cool . Nice falling , yeah . So . Oh , I hadn't thought about that . I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple . Definitely should . Don't throw it away but don't use it in your training . Cool . And Hmm . Right . The only thing I don't like about it is that it 's not phonetically very rich , but . Yeah , that 's right , TIMIT . So we actually talked about that . Yeah , it 's plenty bad . It 's plenty bad just with digits , although I haven't trained any nets on it . I 've just been using existing digits or Broadcast News nets since we don't have enough data yet . One , seven , eight , two , three , one , three , seven , eight , four . M that sorta thing . Yeah . But what were they ? They vary from I I just extracted exactly the same ones , so . That 's like the TIMIT sentences . Greasy wash water , oh . But , so I have a bunch of tools for generating these and for helping transcribe them . Since you know what you know what the transcript is you don't have to type it in , you just have to segment it . So I have tools for doing that . Using X - X Waves , Tcl - TK , Perl , and maybe some C programs too . Well I I don't have any of the print outs . I I print them out a a as I need them . So what I should do is just print out a whole stack and leave them up here but I haven't done that . Well , but i It 's it 's a different task . It 's a different task than read . You you do it differently if it 's sitting in front of you and you 're reading it than if it 's not . So , I guess we could write them down and then read them , but . I I we can get digits . I mean , a as you said , we don't have to be in a meeting . And so if we 're short on digits I can just , you know , capture people in the hallway , drag them in here , and have them read digits for me . That 's right . Well , the the hum we hear right now is actually the projector , not the air conditioner . The projector is much louder than the air conditioning . Yep . Um , no , not normally , not for our meetings . I at least very few of the ones we 've done have we had to do anything on the computer . Right . That 's right , from volume . That 's interesting . Although unfortunately , you know , they 're all pretty close , right ? Oh , look ! Digit strings . That 's right . Oh no !"
