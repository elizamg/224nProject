    "transcript": "OK . Um , w would you mind telling me again , please ? Oh , he 's gonna write it . OK . Now , if the batteries were to go out during the meeting , there 's really what do we do ? Do we have batteries back there ? OK . OK . And you 'll be in your office during this ? Oh , thank you very much . Thanks a lot . Appreciate it . Could you close the door for me please ? OK , thanks . So , thanks very much for coming . OK . So um let 's see , so , um , as you know , the meeting today is to , um , @ @ benefit from your involvement in the data , all the things that that you 've been exposed to in these many months . And um , I just I just put down some ideas you 've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier . And , um , none of these these are not obligatory toca topics but they 're just things that I thought might be useful to discuss , just as a way of organizing the discussion . But if there are other topics you 'd like to discuss that 'd be great too . Alright , so um , it struck me that , um , you know , we could start out with some sort of general thing about , um , things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or , uh , dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type . And then , maybe talk about specifics specifics of the data and then maybe talk about , um , aspects of the conventions and then the technical set - up regarding the , um , auditory image and the interface . OK , so , maybe we could just , um , start with issues of the @ @ the tar ti up there at the top of What what did you find easiest or more s most difficult about transcribing the data ? Yeah . Parentheses , meaning uncertainty . Mm - hmm . Is OK , good . It 's sorta like a foreign language , isn't it ? It 's basically you have these specialized terms for things that I didn't know n needed specialized terms . Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . That 's not a bad strategy . I mean , i it 's it 's true that I I always check the parentheses at the last stage and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context . Not a bad strategy . Yeah . Yes . Mm - hmm . I suspect in context . And also when you have the the juxtaposition of PDA and PZM then , you know , you @ @ in context you can tell which one it 's is probably likely to be the one that you had . Well these here are the P Z Ms , that right there . Uh you 've heard , the \" crown of pain \" . No . He was telling us , uh , before the meeting that , um , that they 're not in circulation right now , that they 're they were unpopular . I liked them , and Adam liked them . I thought the quality was good . What yeah , what did he say ? He said some more things about that , but I was n I was working on something else . Uh - huh . Ah , yeah . Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . Yeah , it 's I liked them . And there 's the actually , there 's the picture of the of the Crown adjustment on the wall right there . So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back . Yeah , good c Yeah . OK , so now what about accents ? Do you have , uh Did you find any p Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . What 's you 've studied some languages , which which ones do you are you studying ? It 's more of a Romance direction , or ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , so it 's not really you 're not really exposed to German very much . Ah ! Interesting . Interesting . Huh . OK . I it 's a good question . Um , And I can't really answer that . Oh . Oh , that 's fascinating . Well , what you can see is that it 's it 's her lack of of English fluency that 's being Yeah , that 's that 's really interesting . I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than s than the others because of my c exposure and interest in German . But , um , I suspect you haven't because this was , uh , earlier on that we had a lot of actually she she was in the middle phase I would say . We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult . But that 's really interesting . Yes . Yes yes yes . Uh - huh . Ex - exactly . \" Miss - ed \" . Uh - huh . Which was you know , you could predict it , I mean , if you knew look looked back at it , they Yeah , interesting . OK . Yeah , I had the same experience . Sometimes And actually Sometimes when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves , \" What did you say there ? \" and they can't tell you . S I think it 's it 's sort of a general variability when it 's not when you 're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level . I also wonder if if it 's partly that Span - Spanish has different pronunciations in different regions ? I mean , do you think that , um , that , uh , maybe I mean , being I mean , not that I would know that . But I just wondered if , um you know , she was from probably continental Spain versus @ @ y you know other Spanish I wonder if that would have a a contributing factor . Yeah . Mm - hmm . That 's right . And in my case with with , uh , German w I a certain region that I do well in and then get farther away from that region and I notice it 's more and more difficult . Yeah . But she was also very low volume . And , um and didn't say a lot . I mean , I I I c I totally agree . This was a a difficult person to to understand . But . I can imagine that , yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish . I 've I found myself doing that somewhat in in German . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . That 's right . Or they 're laughing when they 're talking or they 're Oh . Yeah . Yeah , we had lapels for d l brief And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks , which would mean really basically u uh , a problem that you 're saying of getting input from others , and also , um , it varying when they change their hea w head position . Yeah , but Oh , excellent . Oh , good to know . S so that was You 're talking about early on , the change fro into Channeltrans ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , that 's right . Overlaps . That 's interesting . It 's possible . Hmm . Hmm . Hmm . Huh . Yeah , it seems like it 's it 's related to this production idea . How you you internalize what you 're externalizing in a way , but . Yeah . In the prev You 've also gone through They 've been here since the beginning . You 've also gone through the use the int in in introduction of the pre - segmentation , and that kind of thing . So initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . I see . Mm - hmm . It doesn't hurt to have a pad . It 's it 's nicer to have a pad than not , d but s don't have to be really Yeah , don't doesn't have to be Yeah . Mm - hmm . Nice . Nice . I Ah . Have you Well , I 'm I 'm sort of a hybrid , so I I you know , I I appreciate having them do this , yeah . So , um , in did you have you run into places I 've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin . Have you had that happen ? That 's fascinating . Oh , it 's really a kick . Yeah . There are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of . You 're i it 's h Well , it ge u I 'm sure sometimes on purpose , but sometimes it 'd just be s saying something and especially people who have really lo elongation in their style , and they say , \" That 's really fascinating \" It 's not a great example , but you know ? And Yeah . Uh there 's it 's it 's funny how , um , i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes and I 've run across that also . What I 've done I 've It 's very rare . I mean , when I 've run across it . And , you know , maybe there are times that I haven't detected it and I 'm not @ @ you know , fin I haven't looked at everything . I 've looked at I 've probably looked at per uh s at least eighty percent of the data , you know , all the way through e every meeting for about eighty percent of the stuff that I 've cleared so far . And , um , i it s You guys are getting so good that it 's like I 'm I I i I can get through them faster , and I 'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go through them all the way , you know , so it 's like it 's just we 've gotten to a level , it 's just really great , of , um , of of pre precision that um , it takes a lot of a load off of me . And , um and so I 'm not gonna be checking them all I don't think in the @ @ for throughout the whole rest of the project . But , um Certainly have spot checking . But , um , hhh , those that I have found that way , to me , I think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation . So just do a you know , a mark , then \" fascinating \" , and then put \" PRN \" and uh \" interrupted by a pause \" or , you know , some kind of other gloss like that , you know . You know , \" P R dot dot fascinating \" , whatever it is . Sorry , what was this ? OK . Well , I 've There was an adjustment , and I and I 've switched them all all the way at this point so that Yeah . Yep . Mm - hmm , that 's right . And then in the brackets , what it Uh - huh . So i you know , \" OK \" is a very e easy example . A person says , \" Mm - kay \" then , it 's \" OK \" with a ha a little hatch and then , \" PRN \" and then \" m mm - kay \" , or whatever it is in quotes . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , that 's right . And of course , you know I mean , there 's also this other reduction that w that we 've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says \" and \" versus \" nnn \" versus , you know , \" nd \" , whatever all the different ways of reducing \" and \" . Because you can assume that the speech recognition , um , uh , pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types , and the same thing for , um , well \" the \" . \" The \" versus \" the \" that there are those known variants , and Exactly . And that they should be able to handle themselves , and and that we assume also that for discourse purposes , those distinctions are not really the focus right now , and those distinctions could be added later if needed but it 's unlikely that they would be . And it 's so time - consuming . So we 've made these these simplifying assumptions with that , and so then you begin to think , \" Well what about \" OK \" ? I mean , maybe \" mm - kay \" is an appropriate variant for \" OK \" and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either , so it 's it 's definitely there 's a , uh , choice of how far you go with that , and whether \" kay \" is is enough of a variant you know , it 's th this is a case where , um , I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things but I I sort of figure that i @ @ that that 's not as far aw away from \" OK \" as \" mm - kay \" is , so it 's not quite so but I don't change it back if it 's there , you know . Yes . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , interesting . Oh , that 's interesting . Huh . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Once in a while . Yes . Yeah , I I agree . And and when I when I 'm totally in doubt , if there 's a case where it really could be either , and I could flip a coin , I 'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense , give them the benefit of the doubt that they 're being fluent about it . Mm - hmm . It must be really rare though , I haven't run across that often . Ha - ha h Is it rare ? OK . OK . Well , le let 's see now , there 's another another methodo what I go I wanna ask you at some point , it just occurred to me , I 'd like to ask you the following question , maybe you can have this in the back of your minds , something like , um , you know , what sorts of hypothesis your hypothesis about the you know , ti trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things . What kind of , uh , hypotheses have has this caused you uh , I mean , don't wanna have you give away a paper topic that you wanna explore , but , you know , if there 's interesting th uh , hypotheses that the that y have been suggested to you by looking at the data . That kinda thing , maybe , uh , at some point . So , and al Oh ! And I also wanna say , that , um , I 'd like to meet again also next week , um , and I don't know if this is a good time frame , uh , maybe it 'd be good to have it an hour later or I don't know I mean , could do anything about Good time for you ? OK . OK . OK . Excellent , cuz we could probably move it one hour later , I mean I think , u unless Oh , I see . Wow . You did really well . Yeah . Oh , did you ? OK , OK . Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later ? OK . And th the final question i Oh , that 's right ! Oh ! I thought she said \" mistreat time \" . Yeah , you know , that 's that 's that 's an interesting Hey , they would . Yeah , they would . That 's that 's not a bad solution . Yeah , that 's right , it 's already done . It 's good to s good to have these things all scheduled . OK , so um Oh , uh , eh then I was gonna ask you , what about an hour later ? I mean , if we h had those things an hour later like , would people OK ? OK , good . Alright , so , I 'll I 'll so settle on that . OK now , I wanted to say , you 've been through a couple of different , uh , @ @ improvements in the methods , the pre - segmentation . There was another impro another improvement in that Well , s let 's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint . Uh , the Tigerfish , um , approach . So , uh , s moving from having the first transcription done by an external service , and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves . Ho - ho how Have you And so I think you Yeah , I think you Did you has there already been t Yeah , IBM or if if it was dash TF , that 's the Tigerfish . So d There 's a lot of that . Yeah . Yeah , that 's right too . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Exactly . Exactly , I 'm glad you Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Oh , good to know . Oh , that 's helpful . OK . Wow . Wow ! Wow , OK . Mm - hmm . I 'm not sure if you had an IBM one . So this was earlier on . You probably do . So you didn't get one ? Oh , interesting . No . In neither case . And I 'm and I 'm thinking I 'm thinking you 're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the what they got and IBM didn't Yeah . There 's also some i iffiness about how d if We 're not sure really how Tigerfish does it , you know , the methodology . How do they do this . Because sometimes you 'll have the s the same word , and I 've seen this , like , within well , within a single turn , l it 'll be spelled in three different ways . And it 's like , you know , is this the same person who 's kind of forgetful , or is it that they have several people doing it together ? You know , maybe it 's parallel . Maybe they 're all doing it in parallel and one falls behind and the other one But , who knows ? Well , you know , the The way they 're listening to it is they they get a they get It 's linearized . So if you picture what we have on the screen , um , you know , there 's this block and it goes over I 'm doing it from my perspective . You have this block and it goes over to here and stops and this person starts to talk and he goes over to here and then you have an overlap over here . And so what they would get is this block from the first guy , this block from the second guy , and then the top of the overlap and then the second guy in the overlap . And then it would move on . So it 's sort of like this you know , you go this way as much as you can , then you cycle through there and then you go up to this next level and Um , let 's see , they hear them Oh ! uh , they hear them separately in two chunks , but then sometimes they get confused about who the foreground speaker is , because they 're not being told who the foreground speaker is . You know , and especially you can see if you have like four speakers , it be reason you can maybe find a way of doing that . But with nine speakers So what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there 's something that they think that the f pre - segmenter thought there should be s transcribed in there . And so they 'll get And it 's numbered so that we end up with the same number of of transcribed slots . Exactly . Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered , we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed , and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together because when it comes back to our end , um , it 's just this long string of things that they 've uh , partitioned according to the tape that they were given . Cuz they don't they actually don't have digital interface either so it 's it 's audiotape . And they type it on and then then it comes back to us and Adam and Thilo have a program wa they put it back together into our interface format and then we can use it . But , um , um , there are f cases where you 'll get a segment and it 's someone else 's utterance and that 's because that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two , and you 'll have like two totally parallel r renditions of the same thing . Because i it 's just i n So what they get is like i t is they get something like \" beep one \" . And then then they get \" beep two \" , \" beep three \" . Chuck Wooters does the numbers . And , um , it cycles through . No . And they don't know which channel is s l supposed to be together . Yes , exactly . Yeah , that 's quite right . And that 's why . Exactly right . Yeah . They 're very fast . Is l Yeah . Yeah . It it turns out that they 're really much faster than the other approaches we 've used , and we don't know exactly how they do it and I think that that 's by intention , that @ @ not just me who thinks that it 's that proprietarily , it 's a very competitive business and they probably don't wanna , uh , say too much about it . Yeah . Yeah . But they 're very fast . It 's uh Yeah . Huh . Excellent . Uh - huh . You miss Oh ! I see . Oh , interesting . Oh , how interesting . Yeah . Yeah , OK . Yeah . Mm - hmm . And this is when you crank up the visual . I mean , you 've still got the maximum Yeah . OK . Yeah , it 's true . It 's true , it 's just a big mess . Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . Well , i it 's a judgment call . And you can also say well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , \" Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them . \" Yeah , that 's tr right , That 's quite right . Yeah , that 's right . OK . Yes , I agree . Mm - hmm . c Yeah . It 's it 's good to Yeah . It Well , it 's communicative . Yeah . Yeah . Have you noticed that Tiger - I 've noticed that Tigerfish uses \" cough \" a lot where it isn't really a cough . You notice that ? Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Do you find you 've i This has caused me to wonder . So , in Tigerfish ones , do you find that where they 've where they have like \" dot dot 's \" cuz it 's segments they didn't hear , that that you add u you probably do add things in those places where it 's where nothing is transcribed really , because they didn't even hear it . Yeah . Interesting . Oh , interesting . Huh . Yeah . It just occurred to me , this is a a different kind of question , but I w from having listened to all these people , I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're they 're talking into your ear , really . You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances . Um , I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do . And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are and , \" Oh , you were so funny in that meeting \" and it it has this sort of unusual dynamic because , you know , I I 'm privy to information which really by all rights I shouldn't be , except of course they they agreed , they signed , they were there , they agreed . But but it but it 's sort of an unusual relationship to say , you know , i i you know , if you 're in the meeting yourself , then you of course you 'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about , you know , whether they 're funny or not funny or whatever , but it Oh , that 'd be interesting . Yes . He 's he 's on campus , I found this out . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . Nice guy . Nice guy . Oh , but he is . I went on I actually went on a hike with him two weeks three weeks ago . Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah . Nice guy . Oh , she 's here . Yeah , I 'm sure you 've seen her , uh but Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah yeah , that 's no problem . I also find that some of the you know , if someone sits there and and it th there 's this o one who doesn't say much , but she just is always pleasant . You know , and it 's kind of a smiling voice and she laughs and What a difference . Yeah . I mean it 's like Actually it 's um , she 's she 's just so pleasant . And and , you know , adds a lot just by virtue of that . You know , can People will talk on all these technical things but she 'll she 'll say something technical and then laugh , and It 's it 's very interesting , the ambience that you can get through these these little things . Mm - hmm . I agree with you . I agree , it 's it 's really interesting , Also , i it 's a persona , you get this there 's definitely a sense of persona . Yeah . Yeah . That 's right . Yeah , it 's difficult . Yes . @ @ um , it 's mainly a matter of two things . First is the storage . It 'd be so huge that , uh , you 'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone , that it would be worthwhile doing . And that 's the other thing , that we don't have someone currently doing the video thing . It would really be interesting . Yeah . That was Liz 's idea . Oh , well , it 's a question of feedback , and being able to give feedback . Yeah . Exactly . Yeah . And , you know I mean , th that was the meeting where , um , @ @ you know the m the th y y Partitions wouldn't work . Another possibility is pa partitions wouldn't work because then it would cut off the P Z Ms from having the indirect so it 's like you have these unusual configuration problems that that you wouldn't normally have . Yeah , blindfolds . You know , and someone else said , \" Well , maybe you could just turn the light out . \" But then , someone else said no , cuz there are these m special lights that have to stay on all the time for the fire code or whatever it is . But then That 's right . Yeah , I mean , there are other things we could expand on and with i in terms of the methodology . It 's nice to have a core set of data though and they 've d actually done some they 've had some good results in terms of the digits which they do in terms of having a r a nice broad set of speakers doing the same thing , meeting after meeting after meeting . So , um I 'm wondering , um , so we still technically uh you know I mean , what should we do in terms of tea ? Technically if we could hang on for fifteen more minutes and have tea ? And then continue with this this next next week ? That 'd be great . OK , so , um , let 's see . Yes . Yes . Yeah . Mm - hmm , that 's right . Do you people I mean , does everyone agree with that intu I mean , I f I s share her intuition that 's it 's it is sort of unusual to have \" so \" used as a final , uh , part of a person 's turn . I mean , it 's Mm - hmm . I was wondering . Yes , that 's possible , yeah . Yeah , interesting . Mm - hmm . Of course b but that 's not really an example of this , because they don't just say \" so \" . Is that right ? I mean , s I just wanna be sure . Yeah . Yeah , \" I c I could get all those extra signatures , but I don't know , so . \" That 's a very nice characterization . Interesting . Once again a sh is it a shrug ? Would you say it 's another shrug ? Or OK . OK . OK . Yeah , that 's interesting . Huh . Huh , interesting . What about , um , the way people treat w when they give a joke , I mean , and and they 're like they laugh and then after the laugh they say , \" uh \" . I mean , if you so it 's like , \" ha - ha - ha uh \" . I mean Do you Have you run across this ? And it 's like , to me I I think I 've heard comedians do that . There 's some there 's something there about @ @ you know , you you make a joke and then you have an \" uh \" in there somehow , which I don't really understand the function of . Do you It 's possible , now what I 'm thinking I didn't have the extra the extra e um , what do you say , nuances in the \" uh \" , which you just which you just did . However , the context fits . I mean , that 's an interesting take on it . I think It 's possible . It 's possible . It 's just a normal \" uh \" . Mm - hmm . But it 's stuck in maybe it 's a little louder than usual . It 's not any of the extra , um , you know , glottal thing . Well , but it just seems like it 's more prominent than You know it really is like a placeholder of some sort , like which I think is self - reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker , but Yeah , that 's possible . OK . Oh . It could be . Yes , po that 's possible . It 's possible . Exactly who I was thinking of actually . Uh - huh . Yeah . Exactly . Yeah . That 's true , that would The And he does continue after that . But it 's just you know , to say \" uh \" you kn to say \" uh \" while you 're laughing i it 's just to me it 's an interesting category . That 's possible . Very interesting . Interesting . Yes . Yeah , that 's that 's Huh , OK . Oh n Yes . Yes . He 's very funny . He 's very funny . I I started laughing with something he said the other day , it was it was the beginning of a meeting and it hadn't gotten far into it and and he 's he 's doing this one of these mock fights with Nancy , which he does . Have you run across these mock fights ? And he s he says , um , something like , uh , I i and he 's m e they they have this nice @ @ mutual condescending joking thing going on , and he says , \" Well , I could explain this to you . I have a better laugh than you do . The transcribers told me so . \" And it went on a little longer but it 's li it 's like this really Yeah , and then at one point she you know , at another meeting , she she was not sure which channel she was on , and he said , \" Well , I think you 're on channel so - and - so \" and then she said , \" Well , no , sh shouldn't it be channel so - and - so ? \" and he says \" Well , no , it should be channel so - and - so \" . And then it turned out it was channel so - and - so which he said , and and she said he s he said , \" I bested you again Nancy \" . And she said , \" Yes , that 's my recollection of all of our meetings together \" . They have this really nice You know , it 's really Those sorts of things , i it 's true , you know , it 's like , it really does liven things up to have the , uh , the nice interrelationships . I think I I found that 's a nice aspect of a lot of these meetings , the eh the , uh , eh little periods of humor like that . Alright , well , so do we would would we could do digits if we so desired . If w if we wanted to do that . Let 's do simultaneous digits . No , you don't ? OK , the idea is that you have then , um , you have ground truth , you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said , and then of course sometimes we go through and actually , um , people do double check that they read them correctly and all , so that we 're sure , as you 've done . Yeah . And you did also ? No , because it 's it 's it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface . I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then , you know , leave it , that 's fine . Yeah . Sometimes they don't . Well , if you do that 's that 's alright as well . You don't have to . Because , uh , we 're we have the assumption that we 'll take care of it this in this other way , but In any case , the idea is that you have ground truth , you know exactly what the person should have said and you check to be sure , and usually there aren't many errors eh w when they were checked . Um , and then , you have this multiplicity of voices , uh , reading these things , and you can do really good speech recognition that way . So they have some papers out that they 've done this . It 's really it 's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses . It 's nice to have , you know , a standard Uh , you know , it 's like , uh , psychological approach also that you like to have some standard stimulus here and then you can Yeah . I I agree , I think it 's a nice it 's a nice design feature . Yes , you run across that . Let 's see , I guess it would be it 's up there . Uh - huh . Up there at the top . Yeah . Yeah . Yes . Used to be . Used to be . This they changed them . Initially it was words all spelled out , so \" ONE \" Yes . And that was like a Stroop test in some ways . It took a lot of conc When I was doing those I had to really concentrate . It was like s \" One , s seven \" you know , it was like You really had to \" let 's see , the words and the numbers \" and and then you 'd have an \" OH \" periodically and , um , they were initially spelled out that way , one or the other . But we converted them to this format , and then the idea I mean , you could conceivably put an \" OH \" or a \" zero \" for the \" O 's \" and still have this benefit , but I think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those those locations , and you know , maybe there 'd be Yes , mm - hmm . So , um Sure . Yes . Well , see er also , this has been a a change in the procedure that used to be that they were like uh one long string different sized strings . But to have them broken up like this , it 's it 's m been about uh maybe half a year that that this or maybe maybe seven months , I don't know , maybe longer , that they 've gotten actually broken up within the line . So the idea is @ @ to pause when you see that . No . That 's right , break it up more finely . Well I would say don't worry about that , because , um , this is w again you know , it it 'd be nice to get the words right , but , um , the uh , the interface that these guys used , uh , allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately , so it 's not so important . It 's more important to focus on the words , because there we don't know the ground truth . So . OK , so Well , I don't know , how do you feel ? I mean , what we could do is we could do it together one week and then separate the next or something like that to give the variety . We why don't we do them together this time just because in the interest of time , to get you out in time . OK , so , um , we just start out , we and you s you say , \" transcript L \" whatever it is , and then launch into the numbers and then pause between the gr the gaps and then I guess you 're supposed to treat Yeah , you s well , you 're supposed to treat each line as kind of like a little sentence . What do they say , \" Each line into smaller groups . Please read each string as if you were giving it to someone over the telephone using the groupings indicated .
