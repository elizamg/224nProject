    "transcript": "No , uh , that that wasn't recorded . Temple squeezers . I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . I was just noticing a big s I mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , uh , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . Yeah . Right . Eric on channel nine . There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? I mean , that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . Right . And furth id explore the data further . So . Did they store it digitally , or ? or just put it on videotape ? Or even just have one or two people stay behind . Hmm . Hmm . So I have a question about queries , which is , um , uh I don't know . There you go . OK . Good .

Well , I mean , so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , so that it may not be a feasible thing . But n Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a That was sort of what my question was aimed towards . Do we The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? I mean , does it does the bias matter ? I I don't know . I mean , uh , that 's , I guess , a question for you guys . But Uh , yeah , yeah . Sure , sure . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that I mean , does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? That 's that 's Right . Sure . I agree . I think \" important \" can often be uninteresting . But w It 's not Right . It doesn't it isn't difficult for us to do , so we might as well just do it . \" Here 's a mysterious file and \" Adam ! I 'm not . Oh ! OK . I see . I 'm gonna pass because I can't I mean , of the Jane took my answer . So . Um , so I 'm gonna pass for the moment but y come come back to me . Well , I mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . Right ? So . No . OK ."
